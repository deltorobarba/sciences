        "* The aim in topology is to define structures that permit us to **define what we mean by a continuous function**. The most common way to do this is to **define a family of subsets of a set which we regard as being open**. The family of open sets must obey two axioms: the union of any set of open sets is open, the intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open. I'll also define a neighbourhood of a point as any superset of any open set containing the point. Then we can say **a function from a space X to a space Y is continuous at x if the inverse image of any neighbourhood of f(x) is a neighbourhood of x**. (Try to see how this generalises epsilon delta definitions.)\n",
        "\n",
        "* The aim in measure theory is to **study measures of the size of a set such as length, area or volume (for example in vector spaces, or probability in probability spaces)**. Measures must obey certain axioms, the most important one being that the measure of the union of a finite number of disjoint sets is the sum of the measures. Mostly this is also extended to countable unions. It turns out that **it is not usually possible to define a measure on every subset so we define a class of measurable sets**. These obey superficially similar axioms to open sets. A countable union of measurable sets is measurable and the intersection and difference of two measurable sets is measurable. But notice the different restrictions on the number of sets. (It is quite possible, and frequently happens, that a measure is defined on a topological space. Vector spaces are an example.)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **In measure theory there is a focus on σ-algebras**, i.e. non-empty subcollections of the powerset of a fixed set Ω that are closed under countable unions and complements. **In general topology there is a focus on topologies, i.e. subcollections of the powerset of a fixed set 𝑋 that are closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions**. They “come together” if you are dealing with σ-algebras that are generated by topologies. Then we meet the **Borel σ-algebras**. If you study general topology then you can do completely without measure theory. If you study measure theory then some (not much) knowledge of topology is required. This especially when the Borel σ-algebras are on the menu.\n",
