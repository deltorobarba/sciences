*Quantum algorithms, quantum sensing and communication are key technologies for computational advantage in the future. However, in real-world scenarios, what tangible advantages do quantum data offer, and where can quantum algorithms surpass the best possible classical machine learning approaches? These are core questions that captivate my interest.*

*My passion lies in applying classical machine learning, and quantum algorithms to astronomy and astrophysics. My long-term goal is to utilize quantum sensing with AI in exoplanet research or to uncover new insights in black hole complexity. I'm analyzing various astrophysical objects with real data collected from scientific missions to find measurement limits.*

## Exoplanets ü™ê

*An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside of our solar system.
