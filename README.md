## Astronomy and Astrophysics 🪐 🔭

**Exoplanets 🪐**
*An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside of our solar system. It is detected by observing its effects on the host star, such as the radial velocity method or transit method using [lightkurve](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve) to analyze flux data from Kepler & TESS, [exoplanet](https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/) for probabilistic modeling of time series observations, and [PyORBIT](https://github.com/LucaMalavolta/PyORBIT) for exoplanet orbital parameters.*

* [Kepler8](https://github.com/deltorobarba/sciences/blob/master/exoplanet_kepler8.ipynb) at 3520 light years away

## Gravitational Waves 📡

*Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by accelerating massive objects like Black Holes or Neutron Stars. [GWpy](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/) to access data from gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo, [PyCBC](https://pycbc.org/) astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, [Bilby](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/) inference of compact binary events in interferometric data.

## Galaxies ⭑⋆🔭⋆₊

*Galaxies are systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, held together by gravity. Galaxies are studied through optical, infrared, radio, and X-ray telescopes, which capture emitted or reflected light and other radiation. [galpy](https://docs.galpy.org/en/v1.10.0/) for simulating galactic dynamics, [ProFit](https://pypi.org/project/profit/) for galaxy profile fitting, [imfit](https://pyimfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) for galaxy image fitting, [GALFIT](https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html) for galaxy decomposition.*

## Stars ☀️✨ and Black Holes 🕳️

*Stars are massive spheres of plasma held together by their own gravity, emitting light and heat generated by nuclear fusion.
