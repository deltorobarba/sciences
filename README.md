## Exoplanets ü™ê

*An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside of our solar system. It is detected by observing its effects on the host star, such as the radial velocity method or transit method using [lightkurve](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve) to analyze flux data from Kepler & TESS, [exoplanet](https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/) for probabilistic modeling of time series observations, and [PyORBIT](https://github.com/LucaMalavolta/PyORBIT) for exoplanet orbital parameters.*

## Mission Data üìÇ

*Astrophysical mission data consist of observational measurements across the electromagnetic spectrum, collected by space- and ground-based telescopes. These data allow researchers to analyze the structure, composition, and evolution of exoplanets, stars, galaxies and the cosmic microwave background.
