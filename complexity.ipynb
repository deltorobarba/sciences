Sequential logic has state (memory). Sequential logic is used to store the state of the automaton, which is necessary to track the current position of the tape head and the symbols that have been read (more complex, because requires a larger number of memory elements, and the logic to update the state of the automaton can be more complicated). The sequential logic is implemented using flip-flops, which are memory elements that can store a single bit of information. [Combinational Logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic): output is a function of only the present input. Combinational logic does not have a state (memory). Combinatorial logic is used to determine the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape, based on the current state, the input symbol, and the contents of the tape. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. The ALU is constructed using combinational logic, also half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders, AND, OR, and NOT. The combinational logic is typically much simpler than the sequential logic. This is because the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape can be determined by a relatively small number of input variables.*\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Noble Gases (Helium, Argon, Neon, Krypton)\n",
        "- **Properties:** Noble gases are chemically inert and do not form stable compounds easily due to their full valence electron shells.\n",
        "- **Suitability for Transistors:** Their lack of chemical reactivity and inability to form stable solid structures make them unsuitable for use in semiconductor devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Fluorine (F)\n",
        "- **Properties:** Fluorine is highly reactive and forms strong bonds with other elements. It typically forms ionic or highly polar covalent compounds.\n",
        "- **Suitability for Transistors:** Fluorine is not suitable for forming semiconductor materials. Its extreme reactivity makes it challenging to handle and integrate into electronic devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Oxygen (O)\n",
        "- **Properties:** Oxygen is highly reactive and forms oxides with most elements. Silicon dioxide (SiO₂) is a common example.\n",
        "- **Suitability for Transistors:** While oxygen is crucial for forming insulating layers (such as SiO₂) in semiconductor devices, it is not suitable as a primary material for transistors. Oxygen does not have the semiconductor properties needed for such applications.\n",

        "4. Hydrogen (H)\n",
        "- **Properties:** Hydrogen is the smallest and simplest element. It is highly reactive, forming compounds like water (H₂O) and hydrocarbons.\n",
        "- **Suitability for Transistors:** Hydrogen itself is not suitable for forming semiconductor materials. However, hydrogen is used in semiconductor processes, such as hydrogenation to passivate defects in silicon. Hydrogen molecules do not have a bandgap in the range required for semiconductor applications. Hydrogen is highly reactive. Hydrogen naturally exists as diatomic molecules (H₂) at standard conditions, which do not form a solid with the necessary crystal lattice structure required for semiconductor materials.\n",

        "  2. **Lack of Suitable Bandgap:** Suitable semiconductor materials need a bandgap that allows for effective control of electrical conductivity. Smaller atoms typically do not form materials with the desired semiconductor properties. Semiconductor materials need to have a specific bandgap that allows them to conduct electricity when necessary (by promoting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band) and act as insulators otherwise. This bandgap is typically in the range of 1-2 eV.\n",

Suitable alternatives to silicon typically involve elements that can form stable, semiconductor-like materials with appropriate electrical properties, such as those mentioned previously (e.g., carbon in graphene, elements in TMDs like molybdenum and tungsten, and others).\n",

In a similar vein, most of them also have exponential minimum description length, which makes it difficult to pinpoint examples of exponential complexity. In this work, we construct examples of constant description length but exponential circuit complexity. We provide infinite families such that each element requires an exponential number of two-qubit gates to be generated exactly from a product and where the same is true for the approximate generation of the vast majority of elements in the family. The results are based on sets of large transcendence degree and discussed for tensor networks, diagonal unitaries, and maximally coherent states.\n",

        "* Jens Eisert: Fundamental limits to quantum computation: Quantum computers promise superior computational power over classical computers for some structured problems. While this insight is not new, only in recent years, steps have been taken to actually build intermediate-sized quantum devices, creating an exciting state of affairs. For some paradigmatic problems, there is some evidence that quantum computers may outperform classical devices [1]. For practically motivated problems in machine learning [2, 3] and in optimization [4], fault tolerant quantum computers indeed perform better than classical ones. While this may be promising, actual systems to date are relatively small and noisy. The main part of the talk is concerned with identifying *limitations* to quantum computing in this realm. We discuss notions of learnability of output distributions of short quantum circuits - as they can be seen as parts of variational quantum algorithms - and find that a single T-gate renders learning them hard [5]. We identify exponentially tighter bounds on limitations of quantum error mitigation [6]. We finally discuss the impact of non-unital noise on quantum computing, with quite unexpected results [7]. We end on the note that while fault tolerant quantum computers offer substantial computational benefits, the race is still open for near-term quantum devices.

However, it has been shown that by adding the ability to perform additional primitive functions, to acquire input from the outside world, to perform infinite precision operations on real numbers, or to perform an infinite number of computational steps can all increase the power of the Turing machine and allow it to compute non-recursive functions. doi:10.1016/j.amc.2005.09.076\n",

        "  * The trace distance is defined as half of the [trace norm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Schatten_norms) of the difference of the matrices ${\\displaystyle T(\\rho ,\\sigma ):={\\frac {1}{2}}\\|\\rho -\\sigma \\|_{1}={\\frac {1}{2}}\\mathrm {Tr} \\left[{\\sqrt {(\\rho -\\sigma )^{\\dagger }(\\rho -\\sigma )}}\\right],}$\n",

        "  * The trace distance is a more general measure of distinguishability than the trace inequality. The trace inequality only states that the trace distance between two quantum states is at least as large as the sum of the trace distances between each state and a third state.

Essentially, if you move along a Killing vector, the geometry of the space does not change. In general relativity, Killing vectors are used to identify symmetries of spacetime. For example, in a spacetime that is symmetric in time, there will be a Killing vector corresponding to this time symmetry. Similarly, in a spherically symmetric space, there are Killing vectors corresponding to rotational symmetries.\n",

This is a concept that is particularly important in the study of black holes. In simple terms, a Killing horizon is often associated with the event horizon of a black hole. It is the region where the Killing vector, which represents a certain symmetry (like time translation symmetry), becomes null.

My previous work on effective field theories (EFTs), particularly development of physics models with quantum corrections, gave me an idea.

Because curvature is a measure of derivatives of the spacetime geometry, such terms are called 'higher-derivative terms.' We calculated the effect of these higher-derivative terms on rapidly spinning black holes.\"\n",

        "  * \"Surprisingly, EFT corrections make the singularity jump all the way from the center of the black hole out to the horizon, where you wouldn't expect it to be,\" Remmen said. \"The value of the coefficient in front of a given EFT term—the 'dial settings' in the laws of physics—are dictated by the couplings and types of particle that are present at high energies and short distances. In this sense, EFT coefficients are sensitive to new physics.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Kolanowski, Horowitz, Remmen and Santos also found that the strength of the divergence in tides at the horizon of extremal black holes, and the possible occurrence of tidal singularity, heavily depends on the EFT coefficients. The results of their calculations thus suggest that the spacetime geometry near the horizon of these black holes is sensitive to new physics at higher energies.\n",

        "  * \"Our results are surprising, since they imply that the low-energy description of physics can break down in a situation where you wouldn't expect that to happen. In physics, there's usually a sense of 'decoupling' between different distance scales. For example, you don't need to know the details of water molecules to describe waves using hydrodynamics. Yet for rapidly spinning black holes, that's precisely what happens: the low-energy EFT breaks down at the horizon.\"\n",

        "  * Overall, the calculations carried out by this team of researchers hint at the promise of extremal Kerr black holes for probing new physical phenomena. While the horizon of these black holes can be very large, it was not expected to have an infinitely large curvature (i.e., infinite tidal forces) in the EFT. Their results show that it does.\n",

        "  * \"In future work, we are interested in exploring whether the singularities can be resolved by ultraviolet physics,\" Remmen added. \"A pressing question is whether the sensitivity of the horizon to new physics persists all the way to the Planck scale, or whether the horizon 'smooths out' at the short-distance scale associated with the EFT. We are also looking for other situations in which short distance effects might show up unexpected at large distances.\"\n",

In this talk, I'll review this result and then give a new extension to the setting of computability theory.  Namely, I'll show that a classical or quantum computer with access to a Deutschian CTC (with no bound on its size) could solve exactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem.  Just like in the complexity setting, the most technically interesting part is the upper bound on the power of quantum computers with access to a Deutschian CTC."

        "1. **Holographic Principle**: This is a fundamental idea that suggests that all of the information contained within a given volume of space can be represented by information on the boundary of that space. Think of it as a kind of \"hologram\" where a 2D surface can contain all the information about a 3D volume. This principle was inspired by the behavior of black holes, where the entropy (a measure of information) of a black hole is proportional to its surface area and not its volume.\n",

        "2. **AdS/CFT correspondence**: This is a specific realization of the holographic principle. It's a conjectured relationship between two types of physical theories:\n",
        "    - AdS: Anti-de Sitter space, which is a type of space in gravity theories.\n",
        "    - CFT: Conformal Field Theories, which are quantum field theories defined on the boundary of the AdS space.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The AdS/CFT correspondence posits that a quantum field theory on the boundary (CFT) is equivalent to a gravity theory in the bulk (AdS). This provides a powerful duality that allows for the study of difficult problems in one theory using the tools of the other. In essence, while the holographic principle is a general idea about the nature of information and space, AdS/CFT is a specific, concrete example that ties together quantum mechanics and gravity.\n",

And if you just measured an equal superposition over all possible answers, not having done anything else, the rules of QM dictate that you’ll just see a random answer. And of course, if you’d just wanted a random answer, you could’ve picked one yourself with a lot less trouble!\n",

Famously, in 1994 Peter Shor showed how to do that for the problem of factoring integers, and a few related problems in number theory—but he was able to do so only by exploiting extremely special structure in those problems.\n",

So you get some speedup, but not an exponential one.\n",

This is the content of the so-called BBBV (Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, Vazirani) Theorem, which has several proofs, all of them crucially relying on the linearity of unitary evolution. The BBBV Theorem gives a fundamental explanation for why any fast quantum algorithm for NP-complete problems would have to look very different from anything that we know today—much like a fast classical algorithm would have to*."

Can be computed using the singular value decomposition. *Example: The solution set for two equations in three variables is, in general, a line ([Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations#General_behavior)):*\n",

        "In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. This concept is important because it provides insight into the structure of the matrix, its null space, column space, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "A \"low-rank\" matrix is a matrix where the rank is significantly less than the number of rows or columns. For example, if you have a 1000x1000 matrix (which could potentially have a rank up to 1000), but its rank is only 10, that matrix would be considered low-rank.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-rank matrices are useful in many applications, including machine learning and data analysis. They are often used in techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or singular value decomposition (SVD), where a high-dimensional dataset is approximated by a lower-dimensional one. This is possible because the data can often be accurately represented in a lower-dimensional space (i.e., with a low-rank matrix), which simplifies analysis and reduces computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of quantum computing, low-rank matrices are often easier to work with because they require fewer quantum resources to implement in quantum algorithms. For example, certain operations might require a number of qubits proportional to the rank of a matrix, meaning low-rank matrices can be more efficiently processed on a quantum computer."

        "\n",
        "The condition number of a matrix in linear algebra is a measure of the matrix's sensitivity to numerical errors. This number is used in the context of numerical analysis to understand the stability of a problem, specifically in the context of linear systems of equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The condition number is calculated as the ratio of the largest singular value of a matrix to the smallest singular value. In other words, it gives us a measure of how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a matrix has a low condition number, it means the matrix is well-conditioned, implying that the system of equations has a unique solution, and this solution can be found accurately by numerical methods. The solution will not significantly change even if the input is perturbed slightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if the condition number is high, the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. This indicates that the system is sensitive to small changes in the input, and even a slight change in the input could produce a large change in the result. Thus, the solution may not be accurately computable due to rounding errors and other numerical errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "So a low condition number in linear algebra is generally a good thing, as it indicates a stable and accurate system."

        "\n",
        "Generally, a matrix with a condition number close to 1 is considered to be well-conditioned, which means that it is not sensitive to changes in the input values. As the condition number increases, the matrix becomes increasingly ill-conditioned.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a rough rule of thumb, if the condition number κ(A) exceeds 1/ε, where ε is the machine precision (around 10^-16 for double-precision floating-point arithmetic), then the matrix is considered ill-conditioned. This is because the precision of the numerical computations might be less than the number of digits in the condition number. For example, a condition number of 10^12 would indicate that up to 12 digits of precision could be lost in the computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, condition numbers in the range of 1-10 are generally considered good, 10-100 might be cause for some concern, and 100+ is usually considered problematic, although these thresholds are rather arbitrary and can depend heavily on the specific context and precision of the computations.\n",
        "\n",
