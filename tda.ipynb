        "*We propose an improved quantum algorithm for Topological Data Analysis (TDA) that significantly reduces computational scaling. Our method incorporates advancements like a new Dicke state preparation technique based on inequality testing, a more efficient amplitude estimation algorithm utilizing Kaiser windows, and an optimized implementation of eigenvalue projectors using Chebyshev polynomials. Through our analysis, we find that super-quadratic quantum speedups for this problem are only possible when aiming for a multiplicative error approximation and when the Betti number grows asymptotically. We also show that while exponentially large dimension and Betti number are necessary for a super-polynomial advantage, they are not sufficient. Despite this, we identify specific problem instances where quantum circuits with tens of billions of Toffoli gates could solve classically intractable problems.*\n"

        "**The paper *\"Analyzing Prospects for Quantum Advantage in Topological Data Analysis\"* presents a new quantum algorithm for estimating Betti numbers — topological invariants that count the number of $k$-dimensional holes in a simplicial complex constructed from data. The authors build on prior quantum approaches but introduce several key optimizations to reduce the cost of fault-tolerant implementation, focusing on both asymptotic and constant-factor improvements. Central to their method is the use of the Dirac operator, a Hermitian matrix whose kernel encodes Betti numbers through its spectral structure. By working with this operator instead of the traditional combinatorial Laplacian, they enable a more efficient quantum algorithm that supports qubitization and block encoding techniques.**\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin the computation, the algorithm prepares a Dicke state: an equal superposition over all bitstrings with Hamming weight $k$, which represent subsets of $k$ vertices. From this, a quantum subroutine identifies which of these bitstrings correspond to actual $k$-cliques in the input graph. This clique-checking step is optimized using Toffoli-efficient classical data access, allowing the quantum circuit to mark valid clique states. These marked states are then amplified using amplitude amplification, ensuring the algorithm focuses only on valid simplices.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next step constructs a block-encoded version of the Dirac operator acting on the clique subspace. Instead of performing full Hamiltonian simulation, the authors use qubitization to build a quantum walk operator whose eigenvalues encode the spectrum of the Dirac operator. This avoids overhead from simulating time evolution and enables a clean spectral mapping. They then apply a Chebyshev polynomial filter to project onto the kernel of the Dirac operator, isolating eigenstates with zero eigenvalue — which correspond directly to nontrivial topological features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, amplitude estimation is used to determine the fraction of the total state that lies in this kernel, from which the Betti number is derived. The algorithm is designed to estimate the normalized quantity $\\beta_k / |\\text{Cl}_k(G)|$ with a fixed relative error, and its overall complexity scales as the square root of the inverse of this normalized quantity — offering a quadratic improvement over classical sampling and potential super-polynomial speedups when Betti numbers are large.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the paper, the authors analyze constant factors in Toffoli complexity, provide fault-tolerant cost estimates, and identify parameter regimes (e.g., large Betti numbers and high-dimensional simplicial complexes) where quantum advantage is realistic. They also rigorously compare their method against previous quantum TDA algorithms, as well as known classical dequantization techniques, and argue that their use of spectral filtering, qubitized walks, and minimal quantum memory makes the algorithm robust against known classical simulation strategies. The paper thereby provides one of the most comprehensive and concrete proposals to date for achieving a practical quantum advantage in topological data analysis."
