        "**Traditional LLM Training and GPUs**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Floating-point precision:** LLMs are typically trained using floating-point numbers (e.g., float32) because they offer a wide dynamic range necessary to represent the subtle gradients and relationships between parameters during the learning process.\n",

        "* **Quantization:** qLora (quantized Lora) is a method for reducing the precision of LLM parameters. Instead of storing them as full 32-bit floating-point numbers, it's possible to represent them using lower-precision integers (e.g., 8-bit integers). This drastically reduces memory footprint and computational cost.\n",
        "* **Lora:** Lora (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique that decomposes weight matrices in LLMs into smaller, more manageable components. This decomposition can then be exploited during quantization for efficiency.\n",
        "* **CPU efficiency:**  By reducing the memory and computational requirements through quantization, it becomes feasible to train, or at least perform inference of, LLMs on CPUs, which are more generally available and cost-effective than GPUs in many scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges and Considerations**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Accuracy trade-off:** Quantization generally leads to a slight loss in model accuracy compared to full-precision floating-point representations. The goal is to find the right balance between quantization level and acceptable performance.\n",
        "* **Optimization:** Techniques like qLora and Lora are relatively new, and ongoing research is focused on making them more efficient and minimizing the accuracy loss.\n",
        "* **Deployment:**  If you aim to deploy a quantized LLM on CPUs,  you'll likely need specialized software and hardware support to ensure optimal performance.\n",

        "LoRA is probably the most widely used parameter-efficient finetuning method for LLMs and vision transformers, and DoRA can be seen as an improvement or extension of LoRA that is built on top of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "A brief LoRA recap: Assuming we have pretrained model weights W, LoRA uses low-rank matrices to approximate weight changes ΔW. I.e., in regular finetuning we have W' = W + ΔW, and in LoRA, we approximate ΔW with BA.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the DoRA method first decomposes the pretrained weight matrix into a magnitude vector (m) and a directional matrix (V). Then, it takes the directional matrix V and applies standard LoRA to it, i.e., W' = m (V + ΔV)/norm = m (W + BA)/norm.\n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation for developing this method is based on analyzing and comparing the LoRA and full finetuning learning patterns. They found that LoRA either increases or decreases magnitude and direction updates proportionally but seems to lack the capability of making only subtle directional changes as found in full finetuning. Hence, the researchers propose the decoupling of magnitude and directional components. In other words, their DoRA method aims to apply LoRA only to the directional component (while also allowing the magnitude component to be trained separably.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that introducing the magnitude vector m in DoRA adds 0.01% more parameters than standard LoRA. However, across both LLM and vision transformer benchmarks, they found that DoRA even outperforms LoRA if the DoRA rank is halved, i.e., when DoRA only uses half the parameters of regular LoRA.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, I am actually quite impressed by the results and need to toy with this method in practice. It should not be too big of a lift to upgrade a LoRA implementation to DoRA."

        "Adapter tuning is a technique used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for new tasks more efficiently. Here's the core idea:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Pre-trained Models:** Large language models have been trained on vast amounts of text data, giving them a deep understanding of language patterns.\n",
        "* **Bottleneck:** Fine-tuning these massive models to a specific task (like question answering or translation) often means updating millions or billions of parameters, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n",
        "* **Adapters to the Rescue:** Adapter tuning introduces compact \"adapter\" modules (small sets of new neural network layers) within the pre-trained model's architecture.  Instead of updating the entire model, only the parameters within these adapters are trained for the new task.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages of Adapter Tuning**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Efficiency:** Adapter tuning greatly reduces the number of parameters needing updates, making fine-tuning significantly faster and less computationally demanding.\n",
        "* **Preserving Knowledge:** By freezing most of the original model's weights, adapter tuning preserves the language knowledge the model has acquired during pre-training.\n",
        "* **Multi-Task Learning:** A single pre-trained model can have multiple adapters, each trained for a different task. This allows the model to switch between tasks easily without needing to retrain the entire model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How Adapter Tuning Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pre-trained Model:** Start with a large, pre-trained language model.\n",
        "2. **Insert Adapters:** Add small adapter modules (new layers) between existing layers of the pre-trained model.\n",
        "3. **Freeze the Original Model:** Keep the weights of the pre-trained model frozen.\n",
        "4. **Train the Adapters:** Train only the parameters of the newly added adapters on the data for the specific task at hand.\n",

        "**In Summary**\n",

        "\n",
        "**How ASPIRE Finetunes LLMs:**\n",
        "\n",
        "ASPIRE involves finetuning a pre-trained LLM on a portion of question-answering datasets like CoQA. During finetuning, the model learns to output both an answer and a selection score. The selection score indicates the model's confidence in its answer.  This approach directly modifies the LLM's output behavior, aligning with finetuning.\n",

        "* Here's how RLHF is applied to LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Initially, the language model is trained on a large dataset of text from the internet. This phase is purely supervised learning, where the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence. However, this dataset might not perfectly represent desirable outputs, as it contains a wide range of materials, including low-quality or harmful content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reward Modeling**: After the initial training, human reviewers assess the outputs of the model, providing feedback on its responses. This feedback could be in the form of rankings, ratings, or direct corrections. This human feedback is then used to create a reward model. The reward model essentially predicts how a human would rate a given output, serving as a proxy for human judgment.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: With the reward model in place, the LLM is further trained using reinforcement learning, specifically a method called Proximal Policy Optimization. In this phase, the model learns to generate outputs that are more likely to receive higher ratings from the reward model. This step is crucial for aligning the model's outputs with human values and preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterative Refinement**: The process can be iterative, with further rounds of human feedback and model refinement. This ongoing interaction helps in continuously improving the quality and relevance of the model's responses, ensuring they align well with ethical guidelines, factual accuracy, and user expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying RLHF to LLMs is important for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Alignment with Human Values**: It helps ensure that the model's outputs are aligned with human ethical standards and societal norms.\n",
        "- **Reduction of Harmful Outputs**: By training the model with human feedback, it's possible to reduce the likelihood of generating unsafe, biased, or otherwise undesirable content.\n",
        "- **Enhanced Relevance and Utility**: Feedback-driven training can make the model more useful and relevant to users by focusing on generating high-quality, contextually appropriate responses.\n",

        "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in the context of machine learning, and specifically for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or GPT-4, is an approach that focuses on optimizing the model's outputs based directly on human preferences. This method is a part of the broader framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Here's a closer look at how DPO works and its significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Collecting Human Preferences**: The first step in DPO involves gathering data on human preferences. This is typically done by presenting human reviewers with pairs of outputs generated by the model in response to the same prompt or query. The reviewers are then asked to indicate which of the two responses they prefer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Training a Preference Model**: The collected preference data is used to train a preference model. This model learns to predict the likelihood of one output being preferred over another by humans. Essentially, it aims to understand and quantify what makes one response more favorable or acceptable than another.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimizing the Language Model**: Once the preference model is trained, it is used to guide the training of the language model. The language model is optimized to generate outputs that are more likely to align with the preferences indicated by humans. This optimization can be done using various techniques, including reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterative Process**: Like other RLHF techniques, DPO is often iterative. The model's outputs can be continuously evaluated and compared by human reviewers, and the preference model can be updated based on new data. This leads to ongoing improvements in the language model's alignment with human preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The significance of DPO lies in its focus on aligning the model's outputs with what humans explicitly prefer. This is particularly important for applications where the quality of an output is subjective and can vary based on context and the specific needs or values of the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in a conversational AI, different users might have different preferences for the style, tone, and type of responses they find engaging or helpful. DPO allows the model to be tuned to these preferences, potentially leading to more personalized and satisfactory interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, Direct Preference Optimization represents a powerful method for increasing the alignment of AI systems with human values, preferences, and expectations, thereby enhancing their usefulness, safety, and acceptance in various applications."

The goal of additional training is always and exclusively to improve the quality of the results in a pass@1 fashion.  If you sample from pass@100, use additional compute to rank the results, and select the top 1% of generations for additional training, then you are increasingly biasing the model toward the highest quality results (which is the purpose of training).  It is true the model is already \"able to generalize to the use-case quite well if given enough compute\", but training is all about paying at training time in order to increase the ROI at inference time.\n",

        "Grounding in large language models (LLMs) refers to the process of connecting their responses to real-world entities and concepts. This is crucial for ensuring that LLMs generate accurate, relevant, and meaningful outputs. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, but this knowledge is often abstract and lacks specific context. Grounding allows LLMs to access and incorporate external information to make their responses more grounded in reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several different approaches to grounding LLMs, but they typically involve some combination of the following techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Knowledge base access:** LLMs can be connected to knowledge bases, such as Wikidata or Google Search, to access information about real-world entities and concepts. This information can be used to refine and improve their responses.\n",
        "* **Data retrieval:** LLMs can be used to retrieve relevant data from external sources, such as databases or web pages. This data can then be used to ground their responses in real-world context.\n",
        "* **Physical interaction:** In some cases, LLMs can be directly connected to the real world through sensors and actuators. This allows them to interact with their environment and gather information directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grounding is an essential part of developing reliable and useful LLMs. By grounding their responses in real-world knowledge, LLMs can be more accurate, relevant, and informative. This makes them more suitable for a wider range of applications, such as question answering, summarization, and natural language generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some of the benefits of grounding LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Improved accuracy:** Grounding can help to reduce the number of factual errors in LLM responses.\n",
        "* **Increased relevance:** Grounding can help to ensure that LLM responses are relevant to the context in which they are generated.\n",
        "* **Enhanced creativity:** Grounding can help LLMs to generate more creative and interesting text formats.\n",

        "1. **Retrieval:** When you ask a question, RAG first searches through a knowledge base (like Wikipedia, internal company documents, news articles, etc.) to find relevant passages of text.\n",
        "2. **Augmentation:** This relevant text is appended to your original question, creating a richer, more informative prompt.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Embedding Generation: The LLM takes a query (e.g., a piece of text or an image) and creates a vector representation of it.\n",
        "2. Vector Database: The LLM has a pre-computed database of vectors representing items like text passages, images, or code snippets.\n",
        "3. Similarity Calculation: The LLM calculates the similarity (often using cosine similarity) between the query vector and all the vectors in the database.\n",
        "4. Retrieval: The vectors with the highest similarity scores (closest distance to the query vector) are retrieved. These returned items are considered the most relevant matches to the original query.\n",

        "\n",

        "**ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Purpose:**  ANN algorithms are designed to find items (\"neighbors\") in a dataset that are most similar to a given query, even in very high-dimensional spaces. In LLM retrieval, the query would be the user's input, and the items in the dataset are potential text passages containing relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Role in LLM Retrieval:**\n",
        "    * **Efficiency:**  ANN is crucial for LLM-based retrieval because naively comparing a query to every piece of text in a large database would be extremely computationally expensive. ANN makes this process tremendously faster.\n",
        "    * **Understanding Similarity:** ANN focuses on finding passages that are semantically similar to the user's query, even if they don't contain exact keyword matches. This aligns well with LLMs' ability to understand nuanced meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Types of ANN:** Several ANN algorithms exist (e.g., HNSW, FAISS), each with trade-offs in accuracy, speed, and memory usage.\n",

        "**MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Purpose:** MMR is a ranking algorithm used to ensure diversity and avoid redundancy in search results. In LLM retrieval, it works after ANN has identified potential relevant passages.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Role in LLM Retrieval:**\n",
        "    * **Diversification of Results:** MMR aims to prevent the top results from all being too similar to each other. Instead, it promotes including passages that, while relevant, also cover different aspects or perspectives related to the query.\n",
        "    * **Improving User Experience:** This diversification helps the LLM provide a more comprehensive and informative set of responses to the user, reducing the likelihood of receiving repetitive information.\n",

        "2. **ANN Retrieval:** Using the ANN algorithm, a set of potentially relevant passages is efficiently retrieved from a large text corpus.\n",
        "3. **MMR Ranking:** MMR analyzes the retrieved passages and reranks them, prioritizing both relevance to the query and diversity within the results.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon in which particles can pass through barriers that they would not be able to overcome classically.

        "* The distance at which quantum tunneling becomes a problem depends on a number of factors, including the height of the barrier and the energy of the particles. However, it is generally believed that quantum tunneling becomes a significant problem when the distance between the source and drain is less than about 10 atoms.\n",

The bandgap is the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band.

The higher the bandgap, the more energy it takes for an electron to move from the valence band to the conduction band.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Noise Representation:** Locally flat distributions are used to model a particular type of noise in quantum circuits. This noise has the property that small errors become much more likely than large errors. Locally flat distributions capture this behavior.\n",
        "* **Error Correction and Threshold Theorems:** Understanding the properties of locally flat distributions plays a role in the development of quantum error correction codes.  Importantly, they are connected to the idea of fault-tolerance thresholds – limits on error rates below which quantum computation can be made reliable.\n",
        "* **Simulation and Analysis:** Studying locally flat distributions helps researchers design and analyze quantum algorithms that are robust to this specific type of noise.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Fundamental Building Blocks:** The Pauli operators (X, Y, Z) together with the identity operator (I) form a basis for the space of operators on a single qubit.  This means any operation on a single qubit can be expressed as a combination of Paulis.\n",
        "* **Error Representation:** Many common quantum errors can be represented as combinations of Pauli operators acting on qubits. This makes them convenient for describing noise processes\n",
        "* **Qubit Control:**  Pauli operators are used as quantum gates to manipulate the state of qubits, forming the essential toolkit for quantum computation.\n",

        "\n",
        "**What is Low-Degree Truncation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-degree truncation is a technique used in quantum computing to simplify calculations involving complex quantum systems. It involves approximating a system's Hamiltonian (the operator that describes its energy) by keeping only the terms with low-degree polynomials.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How It Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hamiltonian Representation:**  The Hamiltonian of a quantum system can often be expressed as a sum of terms involving products of Pauli operators (X, Y, Z).  Each term has a degree determined by the number of Pauli operators in the product (e.g., the term XY has degree 2).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Truncation:** In low-degree truncation, you keep only the terms in the Hamiltonian up to a certain degree and discard the higher-degree terms. This simplifies the representation and makes calculations more manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Use Low-Degree Truncation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Computational Complexity:** Simulating complex quantum systems on classical computers can be extremely computationally expensive. The number of terms in the Hamiltonian grows exponentially with the size of the system. Low-degree truncation reduces this complexity.\n",
        "* **Focus on Essential Interactions:** In many systems, the essential physics is often captured by the low-order interactions. Truncating higher-order terms may introduce some error but often provides a good approximation while significantly simplifying the calculations.\n",
        "* **Resource Limitations:** Quantum computers themselves have a limited number of qubits and limited gate depth they can apply. Low-degree truncation can make problems more amenable to simulation on near-term quantum devices.\n",

Quantum states are more powerful than labeled examples (from PAC), because they can represent a superposition of multiple inputs and outputs. This means that a quantum example oracle can provide the learner with more information about the function being learned. ***As a result, quantum example oracles can be used to learn functions that are more difficult to learn with classical PAC learners.*** For example, it has been shown that DNF formulas can be learned efficiently with a quantum example oracle, but they are not known to be efficiently learnable with a classical PAC learner.\n",

A constant function is one that always outputs the same value, regardless of its input. A balanced function is one that outputs 1 half of the time and 0 half of the time. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm works by first creating a superposition of all possible inputs to f. It then applies the oracle to this superposition. If f is constant, then the oracle will not change the superposition. However, if f is balanced, then the oracle will flip the phase of half of the states in the superposition. Finally, the algorithm measures the superposition. If the measurement result is 0, then f is constant. If the measurement result is 1, then f is balanced.\n"

The rule ensures that for certain types of quantum gates (those that generate rotations), the gradient of the expectation value of a quantum circuit with respect to a parameter can be computed exactly, regardless of the number of qubits or the complexity of the circuit. This rule allows the derivative of a quantum circuit output with respect to its parameters to be computed in terms of circuit evaluations. Given a parameterized quantum gate (say, a rotation gate), the derivative of the expectation value of an observable with respect to the parameter can be computed as the difference between the expectation values of the observable for two slightly different values of the parameter. These \"shifted\" parameter values are typically chosen to be a small positive or negative shift from the original parameter value.

This method is efficient in terms of the number of quantum operations required, especially for circuits with many parameters but a single output (as is common in quantum machine learning models). However, it requires the ability to run quantum operations in reverse, as well as the ability to store quantum states, which can be challenging to implement on near-term quantum devices.\n",

This problem is particularly common with activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent, which squish a large input space into a small output range.\n",
        "\n",

        "2. **Weight initialization:** Properly initializing the weights can prevent gradients from vanishing or exploding too quickly. For example, Xavier/Glorot and He initialization are strategies that consider the sizes of the input and output layers.\n",

        "3. **Choice of activation function:** The choice of activation function can help alleviate the vanishing gradients problem. For example, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants (like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU) are commonly used because they do not saturate for positive inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer to prevent the distribution of inputs to each layer from changing too much during training, which can help mitigate both vanishing and exploding gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use of optimizers:** Certain optimization algorithms like RMSProp, Adam, and Nadam can adaptively scale learning rates to mitigate both exploding and vanishing gradients.\n",

A norm-induced metric satisfies the triangle inequality, which states that the distance between two points is less than or equal to the sum of the distances between each point and a third point. However, the Fisher information metric does not satisfy the triangle inequality in general.\n",

The Fisher information matrix for a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance one is given by $I = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n",

        "  * When the Fisher information matrix is degenerate, it means that there is some uncertainty in the estimation of the parameters that cannot be reduced by increasing the sample size. This is because the Fisher information matrix is a measure of the amount of information that the data contains about the parameters.\n",

        "    * Using constraints on the parameters to make them identifiable.\n",

Equivalent to multi-class cross-entropy in multi-class classification, but used to approximate more complex function, e.g. autoencoder for learning a dense feature representation. Minimizing KL divergence (+ squared Euclidean distance) is main way to solve linear inverse problem, via principle of max entropy & least squares (logistic + linear regression). Used in clustering, feature selection (find features that minimize KL divergence between model's distribution and  true distribution when features are excluded), anomaly detection, GANs (similarity between real and generated data). Fisher information is expected value of second derivative of log likelihood function. KL divergence is quadratic form whose coefficients are given by elements of Fisher information matrix.

It is often used in multivariate anomaly detection, classification, and regression.

        "3. **Time Evolution**: Time evolution in quantum computing typically refers to how a quantum state changes over time according to the Schrödinger equation. It is often used to simulate physical systems in quantum simulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Phase Estimation**: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing which estimates the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. It's a key component in many quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and quantum simulation algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Filtering the Zero Eigenvalue**: This refers to the process of isolating or eliminating states with zero eigenvalues. It can be a way of refining results or simplifying calculations in quantum algorithms.\n",

        "Now, to the context you provided: \"Block encoding & qubitization instead of time evolution. Use filtering of the zero eigenvalue rather than phase estimation.\"\n",

        "Similarly, \"using filtering of the zero eigenvalue rather than phase estimation\" suggests a preferential way of isolating the states you're interested in.

        "2. **Construction**: The combinatorial Laplacian is defined for a graph \\( G \\) with vertex set \\( V \\) and edge set \\( E \\) as \\( L = D - A \\), where \\( D \\) is the degree matrix and \\( A \\) is the adjacency matrix.\n",
        "\n",

Specifically, by building on seminal work by Kearns and Valiant, we provide special instances that are hard for classical computers to approximate up to polynomial factors. Simultaneously, we give a quantum algorithm that can efficiently approximate the optimal solution within a polynomial factor. The quantum advantage in this work is ultimately borrowed from Shor’s quantum algorithm for factoring. We introduce an explicit and comprehensive end-to-end construction for the advantage bearing instances. For such instances, quantum computers have, in principle, the power to approximate combinatorial optimization solutions beyond the reach of classical efficient algorithms.\n",

        "Quantum annealing is a quantum computing technique used to find the minimum value of a given objective function over a defined set of possible solutions. It draws inspiration from classical annealing, a process in which a system is gradually cooled to find its lowest energy state. The hope in quantum annealing is to leverage quantum properties, such as superposition and tunneling, to more efficiently explore the solution space and find the ground state, which represents the minimum of the objective function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Connectivity plays an essential role in this process. Let's understand this with a few key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Local Minima and Global Minima**: In complex optimization problems, there are often many local minima. Finding the global minimum (or a sufficiently good approximation of it) is the main challenge. High connectivity means that the system can more easily explore the solution space, jumping from one potential solution to another and avoiding getting trapped in local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Quantum Tunneling**: One of the primary advantages of quantum annealing over classical annealing is quantum tunneling. Tunneling allows the system to \"pass through\" barriers between states, meaning that the system can more easily escape local minima and move towards the global minimum. If the quantum system's connectivity is low, the benefit from quantum tunneling can be diminished.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Effective Exploration of Solution Space**: In a highly connected system, any given qubit (quantum bit) is more likely to interact with many other qubits. <font color=\"blue\">This allows for a richer exploration of the solution space. With fewer connections, the qubits are limited in their interactions, making the exploration less effective.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Scaling Issues**: <font color=\"blue\">as the system size increases, maintaining high connectivity becomes more challenging. The difficulty in keeping high connectivity in larger systems is one reason why quantum annealing's efficiency decreases for more complex NP-hard problems</font>. The sparser the connectivity, the less able the system is to effectively leverage quantum effects.\n",

        "**In quantum annealing, an exponential spectral gap generally presents a challenge** = energy difference between ground state and first excited state is very small. This small gap can make it harder for the quantum annealer to distinguish between the two states, especially when there's noise in the system. \"However, efficiency of quantum annealing is limited by the exponential closing of the spectral gap with increasing system size.\" Problems:\n",
        "  * In order to stay close to ground state throughout annealing process, evolution parameter \\( s \\) or \\( t \\) needs to change very slowly. This can lead to very long quenching times, making annealing process computationally inefficient.\n",
        "  * Thermal Excitations: thermal fluctuations can easily push system out of ground state because energy difference is small. This makes finding the correct solution (the ground state) less likely.\n",
        "  * Small spectral gap implies sensitivity to external noise. Small gap can cause system to be easily perturbed away from desired evolution.\n",
        "  * Techniques and strategies, like optimized annealing schedules or error-correction methods, may be needed to cope with these challenges.\n",

Depending on the problem, this could mean you have a nearly optimal solution, or it could mean you're still far from the best possible configuration.\n",
        "  1. **Nature of the Problem**: The importance of the energy difference can vary depending on the nature of the problem you're trying to solve. In some optimization problems, even a small energy difference might correspond to a significant difference in solution quality. In others, the difference might be negligible in practical terms.\n",
        "  2. **Many-body Systems**: Quantum annealing is often applied to complex many-body systems. In these systems, the difference in energy between the ground state and the first excited state might correspond to a complex reconfiguration of many particles or spins. So, the \"distance\" between these states in terms of system configuration might be significant even if their energy difference is small.\n",
        "  3. **Landscapes with Many Local Minima**: In complex optimization problems, there can be many local minima (sub-optimal solutions that are better than their immediate neighbors). The presence of an exponential spectral gap might indicate that the system is easily getting trapped in one of these local minima. While the first excited state might be close in energy to the ground state, there might be other states with much higher energies that are also close in terms of the system's configuration.\n",

As a variational method, DMRG is an efficient algorithm that attempts to find the lowest-energy matrix product state wavefunction of a Hamiltonian.\n",

        "**How does quantum error correction work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for protecting quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Here's a high-level summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoding**: The first step in quantum error correction is to encode the quantum information. Rather than storing a quantum bit of information (a \"qubit\") in a single physical qubit, we store it in multiple physical qubits. This is done in such a way that, even if some of the physical qubits are corrupted by noise, the original quantum information can still be recovered. This encoding is done using a quantum error-correcting code. There are many different types of quantum error-correcting codes, each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syndrome measurement**: Once the quantum information has been encoded, the next step is to periodically check for errors. This is done by performing a syndrome measurement, which is a special kind of quantum measurement that can detect whether an error has occurred, and if so, what kind of error it was. Importantly, this measurement does not disturb the encoded quantum information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error correction**: If the syndrome measurement indicates that an error has occurred, the next step is to perform an error correction. This involves applying a series of quantum gates to the physical qubits to correct the error, based on the result of the syndrome measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Because quantum systems are always subject to noise, this process of syndrome measurement and error correction needs to be repeated periodically to keep the errors in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's worth noting that the whole process of quantum error correction requires a significant overhead in terms of additional physical qubits and quantum operations. This is a major challenge in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's also worth noting that, although quantum error correction can protect against many types of errors, it cannot protect against all possible errors. In particular, **it's assumed that the errors are relatively rare and do not all occur at once, and that they are independent and identically distributed across the physical qubits**. **If these assumptions are violated, then quantum error correction may not be able to correct the errors**. This is another major challenge in the field of quantum error correction."

        "In quantum computing, Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system. Symmetry is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it refers to the idea that a physical system will remain unchanged under certain transformations. For example, the symmetry of a quantum system may be described by a group of rotations, translations, or reflections. Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system because they have the useful property of being commutative, meaning that the order in which the transformations are applied does not affect the outcome. This property makes it possible to use Abelian groups to describe the symmetries of a quantum system in a way that is mathematically tractable and easy to work with."

In fact, with collaborators we have proven that the color code is equivalent to a surface code (paper) up to a geometrically local unitary (one which only makes nearby qubits interact). One can think by analogy of the surface code* as a napkin with two rough and two smooth sides and the color code as folding this napkin along its diagonal. Because in the folded napkin, there are new things that are now close, it is possible to do more logical gates \"transversally\". This is good because it keeps errors from propagating and is relatively easy. However, the color code needs more qubits to interact in each stabilizer so ends up leading to a lower noise threshold. So one can say that although very similar, each code has its advantages and disadvantages.\n",

        " I am also frustrated by us and the media representing these anyon simulations as a \"step towards fault-tolerance\". Certainly topological codes are inspired by the physics of anyons and there are direct analogies between how those codes work and are realized and these simulations. I also have no doubt that certain aspects of these simulations have some degree of error robustness. But my understanding is that once you get serious about turning such simulations into a form of fault-tolerance appropriate for our devices and then try to optimize its realization you end up with the surface code. So while thinking about the physics of error-correction from this perspective might be useful and there are myriad mathematical similarities between what is going on in these simulations and topological codes, I think it is misleading/wrong to claim that performing these simulations is taking us any closer to fault-tolerance (whether the surface code or a different form of it). People keep telling me that I am misunderstanding this (and maybe I am!) but I have not been convinced of that yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "my objection, which might be different from Cody's, is that the title of this blog post suggests that this experiment is getting us closer to realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In particular, when we say it is a step closer to improved quantum computers, it makes it sound like this approach is somehow a step on our roadmap for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers, or that it is going to make our ultimate goal easier or something like that. That is reading between the lines a little bit, but it is how it sounds to me. Is that actually true? Or is this in the category of \"nice demonstration, but not something we're going to follow up on, and thus not a step towards us improving quantum computers other than in the very broad sense that it helps test hardware capabilities like most physics team experiments do\"? My understanding is that nothing about this experiment is likely to change anything about how we are planning to realize fault-tolerance. Maybe that is incorrect, or it is correct and I am just reading too much into the implications of statements like the title. It would be nice to understand this better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main sense in which the non-abelian anyons are useful for fault tolerance is that they are isomorphic to twists in the surface code, and you can use twists to store logical qubits. But we already knew about twists independent of this work e.g. from https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04673 so I don't know what it adds on the fault tolerance side.\n",
        "\n",
        "I did give a presentation to the authors of our abelian paper on how to do it fault tolerantly (they were technically \"using\" a surface code, but they were preparing it entirely unitarily which is not fault tolerant; you have to use measurements for everything). They weren't so interested I think, because the measurement version is harder and maybe also because they didn't consider it \"really doing it\" in the same way. I actually did run some quick shots of my versions of the circuits on the device back when pink was in M2 shape, and it worked, in that I got non-zero signal (the error rate was close to max but not max). I wasn't doing adept or etc or etc; if an experimentalist did it it would have been better. Also I now have much better versions of the circuit, which are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07395 .\n",
        "\n",
        "My point was that if you interpret TQC as broadly (\"you have things that act like anyons\") then this is demonstrating something interesting (multiparticle entangled EC state, FT gates on that state).  But I also agree with Ryan in that I think the blog post does not convey this well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fair enough, I'm just trying to put forth a perspective on why it is fine to say this is an interesting experiment in topological quantum computation.  And if you want some idea of how it might lead to noise protection, yes  https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912040 which was expanded upon in https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3988\n",

        "\n",
        "Quantum annealing is a quantum computing technique used to find the minimum value of a given objective function over a defined set of possible solutions. It draws inspiration from classical annealing, a process in which a system is gradually cooled to find its lowest energy state. The hope in quantum annealing is to leverage quantum properties, such as superposition and tunneling, to more efficiently explore the solution space and find the ground state, which represents the minimum of the objective function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Connectivity plays an essential role in this process. Let's understand this with a few key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Local Minima and Global Minima**: In complex optimization problems, there are often many local minima. Finding the global minimum (or a sufficiently good approximation of it) is the main challenge. High connectivity means that the system can more easily explore the solution space, jumping from one potential solution to another and avoiding getting trapped in local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Quantum Tunneling**: One of the primary advantages of quantum annealing over classical annealing is quantum tunneling. Tunneling allows the system to \"pass through\" barriers between states, meaning that the system can more easily escape local minima and move towards the global minimum. If the quantum system's connectivity is low, the benefit from quantum tunneling can be diminished.\n",

With fewer connections, the qubits are limited in their interactions, making the exploration less effective.</font>\n",

        "4. **Scaling Issues**: <font color=\"blue\">as the system size increases, maintaining high connectivity becomes more challenging. The difficulty in keeping high connectivity in larger systems is one reason why quantum annealing's efficiency decreases for more complex NP-hard problems</font>.

        "If you imagine continually increasing the number of qubits as complexity theorists do, and you also want to account for errors, you need to decide whether you’re also going to keep adding more layers of gates — increasing the circuit depth, as researchers say. Suppose you keep the circuit depth constant at, say, a relatively shallow three layers, as you increase the number of qubits. You won’t get much entanglement, and the output will still be amenable to classical simulation. On the other hand, if you increase the circuit depth to keep up with the growing number of qubits, the cumulative effects of gate errors will wash out the entanglement, and the output will again become easy to simulate classically."

        "* Challenge: you can‘t go to 80 qubits or so, because then it is impossible for a classical computer to verify. Google used 53 qubits, because then you can at least verify (with 10,000 years on classical computer, doing extrapolation). But this opens the door to spoof the results classically (-> what did aaronson mean by that?)\n",
