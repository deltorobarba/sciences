Since any unitary operation, state preparation and the projection measurement in the computational basis can be simulated in a correlation space, it is natural to expect that fault-tolerant quantum circuits can also be simulated in a correlation space. However, we point out that not all physical errors on physical qudits appear as linear completely-positive trace-preserving errors in a correlation space. Since the theories of fault-tolerant quantum circuits known so far assume such noises, this means that the simulation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits in a correlation space is not so straightforward for general resource states.\n",

For example, a system might be in state |0⟩ with probability 1/2 and in state |1⟩ with probability 1/2.

        "The fat-shattering dimension is a complexity measure used in statistical learning theory. It's one way of quantifying the complexity or expressive power of a class of functions, and it's used to derive bounds on the generalization error of a learning algorithm. \n",
        "\n",
        "The formal definition of the fat-shattering dimension is a bit technical, but here's the general idea: suppose you have a class of functions, and you want to understand how complex this class is. One way of doing this is to look at how these functions can separate or \"shatter\" sets of points. If you can find large sets of points that can be arbitrarily labeled (i.e., \"shattered\") by functions in your class, then the class has high complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, for the fat-shattering dimension, you add an additional constraint: you require a certain margin (the \"fatness\") between points that are labeled differently. The largest set of points that can be shattered with a given margin is used to define the fat-shattering dimension of the function class. \n",
        "\n",
        "The fat-shattering dimension is related to the VC dimension (Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension), another complexity measure that is widely used in statistical learning theory. However, while the VC dimension only considers exact separation of points, the fat-shattering dimension takes into account this idea of a margin, which makes it more suitable for dealing with \"noisy\" or non-separable data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of the fat-shattering dimension is often used in the analysis of machine learning algorithms, particularly those based on empirical risk minimization. It can help to understand the trade-off between the expressive power of a function class (which often corresponds to the complexity of a learning algorithm) and the ability of the algorithm to generalize well to unseen data."

        "Quantum complexity theory is a branch of theoretical computer science that studies the resources, like time and space, needed for quantum computers to solve problems. It's the quantum analog to classical complexity theory. Here are some key points to understand about quantum complexity theory:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Quantum Computation Models**: The most commonly studied model of quantum computation is the quantum circuit model, which is analogous to the classical circuit model. There's also the quantum Turing machine, a quantum analogue to the classical Turing machine, but it's used less frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Complexity Classes**: Just like in classical complexity theory, problems in quantum complexity theory are grouped into complexity classes based on the resources needed to solve them. The most famous is probably BQP (Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial time), which consists of problems that can be solved efficiently (in polynomial time) by a quantum computer with an error probability of at most 1/3. Other important quantum complexity classes include QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur), the quantum analogue of the classical class NP.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Quantum Speedup**: Some problems can be solved more efficiently on quantum computers than on classical computers. The most famous examples are factoring integers (Shor's algorithm) and unordered searching (Grover's algorithm), which offer a so-called \"quantum speedup\". However, for many problems, it's still an open question whether quantum computers offer a significant advantage over classical computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Quantum vs Classical Complexity**: One of the most important open problems in quantum complexity theory (and indeed in all of computer science) is whether BQP is equal to P (the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic classical computer). In other words, it's still an open question whether there are problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer but not by a classical computer. Most experts believe that BQP is larger than P (meaning that quantum computers are more powerful), but this hasn't been formally proven.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Quantum Error Correction**: Quantum error correction is a key consideration in the study of quantum complexity theory. Quantum computations are very susceptible to errors, and correcting these errors requires additional resources. Understanding the trade-off between error correction and computational efficiency is a major topic of study in quantum complexity theory.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to study quantum complexity theory, you'll need a solid background in both classical complexity theory and quantum mechanics, as well as comfort with advanced mathematical concepts like linear algebra, probability theory, and group theory."

        "Ewin Tang, in her breakthrough work in 2018, presented a classical algorithm that can solve a problem almost as fast as the best quantum algorithm can. This came as a surprise because, until then, it was believed that quantum computers could significantly speed up the solution to such problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tang's focus was on a specific type of problem used in recommendation systems. For example, if you have a large group of users, each of whom has rated a subset of a large set of products, a recommendation system can predict how a user would rate products they have not yet rated. The core of this problem is to identify items that are similar to those the user has already shown a preference for. \n",
        "\n",
        "The most prominent quantum algorithm for recommendation systems was based on something called the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, a quantum algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations, which was believed to be exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ewin Tang's genius was to show a classical algorithm that could solve this recommendation problem almost as fast as the quantum version. The \"dequantization\" process involves using similar principles that the quantum algorithm uses, but translating them to a classical context. \n",
        "\n",
        "More technically, Tang’s algorithm builds on a classical data structure called a \"tree of singular vectors,\" which is used to approximate the product of the preference matrix with a vector that represents a new user's preferences. This approximation is good enough to recommend items in a way that's nearly as good as the quantum algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that the success of Tang's algorithm relies heavily on the specifics of the recommendation system problem - specifically, the fact that the user-product preference matrix has a certain property called \"low rank.\" Therefore, it doesn't mean that all quantum algorithms can be dequantized in the same way. It does, however, represent an important conceptual breakthrough, showing that the boundary between classical and quantum computing is not as clear-cut as it was once believed to be.\n",
        "\n",
        "other explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ewin Tang made a breakthrough in computer science in 2018 by finding a classical algorithm that solves a problem just as quickly as the best-known quantum algorithm. This result came as a surprise because it was previously believed that quantum computers would be needed to achieve such a speed-up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tang studied a problem known as recommendation systems, which is a task that lies at the heart of platforms like Netflix and Amazon. The quantum version of the recommendation system problem is known as the \"quantum singular value transformation,\" and was thought to give an exponential speed-up over any possible classical algorithm. Tang's work \"dequantizes\" this problem, meaning she derived a classical algorithm that achieves a similar performance to the quantum algorithm, thus closing what was seen as a \"quantum supremacy\" gap.\n",
        "\n",
        "In more technical terms, Tang's classical algorithm uses similar ideas and techniques to the quantum one but in a classical setting. The approach relies on a form of algorithm called \"randomized sampling algorithms\" and works by creating a probability distribution that closely matches the one that would have been created by a quantum computer. By cleverly sampling from this distribution, Tang's algorithm can estimate the answers to the recommendation problem almost as accurately as the quantum version.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tang's work has implications for the field of quantum computing. It highlights that the theoretical understanding of the boundaries between classical and quantum computation is still incomplete, and there may be more situations where seemingly quantum-exclusive speed-ups can be achieved by classical means. However, it also stresses that quantum supremacy might be more difficult to achieve than initially thought, and that claims of quantum advantage should be thoroughly scrutinized."

        "In quantum computing, the no-cloning theorem is a fundamental principle which states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This rule has some important implications for reading out the state of a quantum system.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have a quantum system in a superposition of many states (let's say, for simplicity, that we're dealing with a string of qubits in a quantum computer), each individual state corresponds to a \"piece of information.\" In a perfect world, if you could clone this quantum state, you might imagine making many copies of it and measuring each one to read out all the possible states -- essentially reading out all the pieces of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the no-cloning theorem forbids this. You can't make those copies. What's more, when you perform a measurement on a quantum system, it \"collapses\" into one of its possible states according to its probability distribution, giving you just one piece of information from your superposition. And after the measurement, the rest of the information in the original superposition is lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, if you want to know the full quantum state (i.e., all the entries), you would have to prepare identical copies of your original state and measure each one, hoping to eventually see every possible outcome. If your quantum state is a superposition of many possibilities, it would take an exponential amount of time to get a good chance of seeing every possibility. This is in stark contrast to a classical bit string where you could just read out every bit individually in a linear amount of time. \n",
        "\n",
        "That's why the no-cloning theorem limits our ability to fully read out the state of a quantum system: each measurement only gives you a tiny piece of the picture, and you would have to repeat the process an exponential number of times to see the full state."

        "Quantum computers use principles of quantum physics to perform computations, and while they promise significant computational speed-ups for certain problems, it's important to understand that this speed-up is not universal for all types of problems. The difficulty in achieving an exponential speed-up in quantum linear algebra (and many other problems) is due to several factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The nature of the problem**: Not all problems are amenable to quantum speed-up. Quantum algorithms are specifically efficient for problems where a superposition of solutions can be created and manipulated - this includes factoring integers (Shor's algorithm) and searching databases (Grover's algorithm). Linear algebra problems, especially in high dimensions, may not easily lend themselves to such superposition-based speed-ups.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Qubit limitations and error correction**: Quantum information is delicate and can be easily disrupted. Building a quantum computer with enough qubits to offer an exponential speedup for complex problems, and which also has enough error correction to prevent the computation from being disrupted, is a significant engineering challenge. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, these challenges are still unsolved.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Output limitations**: Even if a quantum computer can perform a computation faster, it might not be able to provide the result in a way that's useful or can be checked in a reasonable time by a classical computer. This limitation is a crucial aspect in quantum linear algebra problems. For example, you can load a vector into a quantum state exponentially faster, but you cannot read out all the entries in less than exponential time due to the 'no-cloning' theorem of quantum mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Efficient classical algorithms**: In some cases, we already have very efficient classical algorithms for linear algebra problems. This means that a quantum algorithm would have to offer an extreme speed-up to be advantageous. Sometimes, we later find that classical algorithms can be further optimized, which narrows the gap between classical and quantum computation. This is what happened in Ewin Tang's dequantization of the recommendation systems problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Difficulty of programming and handling quantum algorithms**: Quantum algorithms are inherently more difficult to design and implement due to the intrinsic nature of quantum mechanics, which includes superposition, entanglement, and interference. Moreover, real-world quantum systems are often noisy and error-prone, making it even more challenging to implement quantum algorithms reliably.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Vanishing gradients:** When deep neural networks are trained, gradients of the loss function can become very small. As a result, weight updates during training become insignificant, and the network takes a very long time to learn, if it can learn at all. This problem is particularly common with activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent, which squish a large input space into a small output range.\n",

        "\n",
        "Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate these issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Gradient clipping:** This is a common technique to prevent exploding gradients. If the norm of the gradient exceeds a certain threshold, we scale it back to prevent it from getting too large.\n",

        "1. **Non-commutativity of operators**: Quantum operations, unlike classical ones, are represented by operators that generally do not commute, meaning the order in which they are applied matters. This non-commutativity makes the computation of gradients more complex than in the classical case.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Measurement**: In quantum mechanics, obtaining information about the state of a system involves measurement, which is a probabilistic process that collapses the state of the system. The inherent randomness of measurement makes the direct application of backpropagation problematic.\n",

        "4. **Barren plateaus**: In the context of variational quantum algorithms, it's been found that the cost function landscape often suffers from the problem of \"barren plateaus\", where the function is flat almost everywhere. This makes it difficult for gradient-based methods like backpropagation to find a direction to move in to improve the function.\n",

Given a parameterized quantum gate (say, a rotation gate), the derivative of the expectation value of an observable with respect to the parameter can be computed as the difference between the expectation values of the observable for two slightly different values of the parameter. These \"shifted\" parameter values are typically chosen to be a small positive or negative shift from the original parameter value.\n",

In this work, we examine the assumptions that give rise to barren plateaus and show that an unbounded loss function can circumvent the existing no-go results. We propose a training algorithm that minimizes the maximal Renyi divergence of order two and present techniques for gradient computation. We compute the closed form of the gradients for Unitary QNNs and Quantum Boltzmann Machines and provide sufficient conditions for the absence of barren plateaus in these models. We demonstrate our approach in two use cases: thermal state learning and Hamiltonian learning. In our numerical experiments, we observed rapid convergence of our training loss function and frequently archived a 99% average fidelity in fewer than 100 epochs.\n"

A neural network with a single layer can approximate any continuous function given enough neurons (this is known as the universal approximation theorem), but it may require a very large number of neurons to do so. Adding more layers to the network (making it a deep network) can increase its expressibility, allowing it to approximate complex functions more efficiently.\n",

        "\n",
        "One of the key challenges of the quantum machine learning field is identifying learning problems where quantum learning algorithms can achieve a provable exponential speedup over classical learning algorithms. The currently known examples are all contrived, and all rely on cryptographic methods to make learning hard for a classical learner. However, the broadly shared intuition is that learning separations should in particular be most apparent when the learning task involves data from genuinely quantum sources, which are very different from cryptographic problems. In this talk I will discuss this apparent discrepancy and present a series of new results showing various types of advatnages that can be obtained. In particular, we show how many complex physical systems have associated learning problems which exhibit exponential separations, subject to plausible assumptions in complexity theory, giving a confirmation of the intuition."

        "Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms, like all quantum algorithms, come with their unique set of challenges. Here are some of the main challenges faced when using VQE algorithms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Noise**: VQE algorithms, like all quantum algorithms, are sensitive to noise. This includes noise from imperfect quantum gates, decoherence, and readout errors, among other sources. This noise can lead to errors in the estimated energy eigenvalues. Error mitigation techniques and quantum error correction are still active areas of research.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Circuit Depth**: VQE algorithms often require deep circuits, meaning circuits with many quantum gates applied in sequence. The longer the sequence, the more time there is for errors to accumulate, leading to less accurate results. This is particularly a challenge for near-term quantum computers (\"noisy intermediate-scale quantum\" or NISQ devices), which have limited coherence times.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Classical Optimization**: VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, meaning it involves both a quantum computation (to evaluate the energy of a quantum state) and a classical computation (to optimize the parameters of the quantum state based on the results of the quantum computation). The classical optimization part can be challenging, especially in cases where the optimization landscape is non-convex and includes many local minima. This can cause the optimization routine to get stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ansatz Selection**: The efficiency and effectiveness of VQE are highly dependent on the choice of the ansatz, which is the form of the quantum state that we're optimizing. The ansatz needs to be expressive enough to represent the ground state of the system accurately, but simple enough to be implementable on a quantum computer. Finding the right balance is a non-trivial task.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Measurement**: VQE requires the measurement of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, which often involves decomposing the Hamiltonian into a sum of simpler terms that can be measured independently. This can sometimes require a large number of measurements, especially for systems with many qubits and complex Hamiltonians.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Scalability**: As with any quantum algorithm, there's a question of how well VQE can scale with the size of the system it's being used to simulate. The complexity of the Hamiltonian, and thus the depth and complexity of the quantum circuit, often increases rapidly with the size of the system, making it challenging to simulate large systems with VQE.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Barren Plateaus**: This is a problem where the landscape of the cost function that you are trying to optimize becomes exceedingly flat as the number of qubits (or circuit depth) increases. This makes it hard for the classical optimizer to find the global minimum because gradients provide almost no useful direction in these \"barren plateau\" regions. \n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these challenges, VQE algorithms are an active area of research due to their promise for performing useful quantum computations with near-term quantum devices. Improving VQE algorithms and developing strategies to mitigate these challenges is a key focus for many researchers in quantum computing.\n"

        "Der Shor-Algorithmus lässt sich am besten für die Primfaktorzerlegung erklären. Damit Quantencomputer diese Aufgabe meistern können, muss man das Problem allerdings etwas umformulieren. Denn der Quantenalgorithmus stützt sich auf eine Anleitung zum Faktorisieren von Zahlen, die aus den 1970er Jahren stammt. Damals fand man heraus, dass nur vier Schritte nötig sind, um die Primfaktoren p und q einer Zahl N = p·q zu berechnen.\n",

        "[Hidden Subgroup Problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem) (HSP) generalizes many problems on which quantum computers offer a potential exponential speed-up over classical computers and derives its significance from two important and related questions. First, the study of the problem sheds some light on what it is that quantum computers are really good at. Second, the ability to solve HSP for non-Abelian groups in polynomial time would enable us to extend the set of problems on which quantum computers offer substantial performance advantage. In this introductory talk, I will recap essential concepts from group theory before defining the Hidden Subgroup Problem and describing the quantum algorithm that solves it quickly. I will end by showing how to express a number of well-known problems, such as Simon's problem, discrete logarithm and graph isomorphism, as instances of HSP.\n"

In simpler terms, the problem involves finding a hidden structure within a group based on the information provided by the function.\n",

        "The main challenge in the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) is to efficiently find the hidden subgroup within a given group based on the information provided by a function. The difficulty lies in identifying the underlying structure or pattern that the function reveals about the subgroup.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key aspects that makes the HSP challenging is that the function only provides partial information about the subgroup. The function maps elements of the group to a set of values, but it does not directly reveal the subgroup itself. Instead, the function is designed in such a way that it distinguishes elements of different cosets of the hidden subgroup while keeping elements within the same coset indistinguishable. This limited information makes it difficult to directly extract the subgroup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge is that the HSP encompasses a wide range of group structures. While some specific cases of the problem have been efficiently solved using quantum algorithms, finding a general solution that works for arbitrary groups remains an open question. The difficulty varies depending on the properties and structure of the group involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the HSP is of particular interest in the field of quantum computing because it has the potential to break certain cryptographic protocols. Efficiently solving the HSP for specific groups could lead to the development of quantum algorithms that can break widely used encryption schemes based on problems like factoring large numbers or solving the Discrete Logarithm Problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite efforts to develop quantum algorithms for the HSP, no general solution has been found yet. The challenge lies in understanding the underlying mathematical structures, devising efficient algorithms, and leveraging the power of quantum computation to solve the problem in a scalable and practical manner."

        "Boson Sampling is a computational problem related to quantum computing. It was proposed by Scott Aaronson and Alex Arkhipov in 2011 and is intended to demonstrate the potential power of quantum computers over classical ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic problem is this: Given a linear optical network (a device that takes in multiple photons, passes them through a series of beam splitters and phase shifters, and then outputs them), where each photon is initially sent into a different input mode, the task is to sample from the probability distribution of photon count outcomes at the network's outputs. \n",
        "\n",
        "In more detail, you start with an arrangement of beam splitters and phase shifters that form a linear optical network. You inject a number of indistinguishable single photons into this network. The photons then interact with the network and with each other due to quantum interference and finally are detected at the output. The task is to compute the probabilities of different detection patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Boson Sampling is believed to be hard for classical computers, yet could be solved efficiently with a relatively rudimentary type of quantum computer - one that can prepare certain states of multiple photons and feed them into a linear optics network. \n",
        "\n",
        "The importance of Boson Sampling lies in its implications for the question of whether quantum computers can do things that classical computers cannot. If it's proven that Boson Sampling can't be efficiently simulated on a classical computer (which is believed to be the case but hasn't been formally proven as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021), then this would be strong evidence of the power of quantum computation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, Boson Sampling experiments can be performed with current technology, and in fact, several experimental groups have demonstrated small-scale Boson Sampling. A significant milestone was reached in 2020 when a team from the University of Science and Technology of China reported results from a 50-photon Boson Sampling experiment, which would be infeasible to simulate exactly with a classical computer. However, the demonstration of \"quantum supremacy\" via Boson Sampling remains a topic of active debate and research.\n"

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm, and as such it is inherently designed to run on quantum computers. It uses principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and interference, to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, the key idea behind QAOA can be translated into a classical, or \"quantum-inspired\", algorithm. The central concept of QAOA is the idea of using a quantum system to explore a large solution space more effectively than classical algorithms. This concept can be mimicked on a classical computer, albeit with some limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a simplified overview of how the quantum-inspired version of QAOA might work:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initial State:** Similar to QAOA, a quantum-inspired algorithm would start with an initial state that is a superposition of all possible solutions. On a classical computer, this might be represented as a probability distribution over all possible solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cost and Mixer Functions:** QAOA uses two types of quantum operations (unitary transformations) in its procedure: a cost function and a mixer function. The cost function encodes the problem's objective, and the mixer function helps to explore the solution space. In a quantum-inspired algorithm, these could be represented as operations on the probability distribution that adjust the probabilities based on the cost function and allow exploration of the solution space.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Iterative Process:** Like QAOA, a quantum-inspired algorithm would iteratively apply the cost and mixer functions. This iterative process is intended to gradually \"steer\" the system towards better solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Measurement:** Finally, in QAOA, a measurement is performed on the quantum state to obtain a solution. In a quantum-inspired algorithm, a solution might be selected based on the final probability distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "It should be noted that while quantum-inspired algorithms can provide speed-ups for certain problems, they do not offer the same potential exponential speed-ups that true quantum algorithms might provide on quantum computers. The simulation of quantum behaviors on classical computers is inherently limited by the classical computational resources, and the quantum-inspired algorithms typically run in exponential time complexity. However, they may still offer advantages over traditional classical algorithms for certain tasks.\n"

        "\n",
        "Tensor networks are a mathematical tool used in many areas of physics, including quantum mechanics and quantum computing. They are particularly useful for modeling quantum systems with many particles, which are generally hard to simulate on classical computers due to the exponential growth in complexity. \n",
        "\n",
        "In a tensor network, each tensor is a mathematical object that can represent quantum states, and the network captures the relationships and interactions between these states. When used in quantum-inspired algorithms, tensor networks allow for the efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states, which can lead to significant speedup in the solution of certain problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few ways tensor networks are applied in quantum-inspired algorithms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Quantum Simulation:** Tensor networks can be used to simulate the behavior of quantum systems. This is often used in condensed matter physics but can also be applied to quantum computing. By using tensor networks, we can represent the states of a quantum system in a way that allows us to perform calculations more efficiently than we would be able to with a naive representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Machine Learning and Data Compression:** Tensor networks can be used to compress high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. This is particularly useful in machine learning, where high-dimensional data is the norm. Quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms can leverage this property to handle large datasets efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Quantum Circuit Simulation:** Tensor networks can be used to simulate quantum circuits, which is a crucial component of quantum computing. By using tensor networks, we can simulate the operation of a quantum circuit more efficiently, especially when dealing with large, complex circuits.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Solving Optimization Problems:** Tensor networks can also be used to solve optimization problems. By mapping the problem onto a tensor network, we can use techniques like the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) to find the optimal solution. This is particularly useful for problems where the number of variables is large, as is often the case in optimization problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Quantum Error Correction:** Tensor networks have also been used in the study and implementation of quantum error correction codes. These codes are crucial for dealing with the inherent noise and instability in quantum systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In all these cases, the key advantage of tensor networks is their ability to represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional quantum states in a computationally efficient manner. However, it's important to note that while tensor networks provide a powerful tool for quantum-inspired algorithms, they are not a magic bullet. They work best for certain classes of problems and quantum states, particularly those with low entanglement.\n"

While the classical Lanczos method has exponential cost in the system size to represent the Krylov states for quantum systems, our efficient quantum algorithm achieves this in polynomial time and memory. The construction presented is exact in the sense that the resulting Krylov space is identical to that of the Lanczos method, so the only approximation with respect to the exact method is due to finite sample noise. This is possible because, unlike previous quantum Krylov methods, our algorithm does not require simulating real or imaginary time evolution. We provide an explicit error bound for the resulting ground state energy estimate in the presence of noise. \n",

        "Shadow tomography, also known as X-ray phase-contrast imaging or phase tomography, is a technique used to create detailed three-dimensional images of an object's internal structure. It is primarily employed in the field of medical imaging but also finds applications in materials science and other areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional X-ray imaging relies on the attenuation of X-rays as they pass through different tissues or materials, resulting in a two-dimensional projection image that shows variations in X-ray absorption. However, some tissues or materials have similar absorption properties, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on their attenuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography overcomes this limitation by exploiting the phase shift of X-rays as they pass through an object. When X-rays encounter a boundary between two materials with different refractive indices, they undergo a phase shift. This phase shift contains valuable information about the object's internal structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform shadow tomography, a coherent X-ray source, such as a synchrotron or an X-ray tube, is used. The X-rays pass through the object and are collected by a detector placed behind it. The collected X-rays contain both intensity and phase information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to shadow tomography lies in extracting the phase information from the intensity measurements. This is typically achieved by using specialized techniques such as interferometry or grating-based methods. These methods create interference patterns that encode the phase information, which can then be computationally reconstructed into a three-dimensional image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting shadow tomography image provides not only information about the X-ray absorption but also about the object's refractive index distribution and other structural features. This enables visualization of fine details, such as boundaries between tissues or subtle density variations, which may not be easily distinguishable in traditional X-ray images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance our understanding of complex biological and materials systems. However, it currently requires advanced X-ray sources and specialized techniques, limiting its widespread availability in clinical settings. Nevertheless, ongoing research and technological advancements aim to make shadow tomography more accessible and applicable in various fields."

Quantum state tomography aims to reconstruct or characterize the complete quantum state of a system by performing measurements on the system in different bases or using various observables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography of quantum states is a specific technique used for quantum state reconstruction. It involves measuring the shadows or projections of the quantum state onto a set of measurement operators or observables. These measurements provide partial information about the quantum state, similar to the way shadows reveal information about the object casting them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The procedure for shadow tomography of quantum states typically involves preparing the system in different known initial states, applying a set of measurements or observables to the system, and then collecting the measurement outcomes. By repeating this process for a sufficiently large number of initial states and measurements, it becomes possible to reconstruct the complete quantum state of the system through computational methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reconstructed quantum state provides valuable information about the system's properties, such as its purity, entanglement, coherence, and other relevant characteristics. This information is crucial for understanding and characterizing quantum systems, as well as for verifying the performance of quantum devices and protocols.\n",

        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

        "Um einen quantenmechanischen Zustand eindeutig zu charakterisieren, sind oft mehrere Observablen notwendig. Beispielsweise ist es beim Wasserstoffatom nicht ausreichend, nur die Energie anzugeben (mittels der Hauptquantenzahl n), sondern es sind zwei weitere Observablen notwendig: der Betrag des Drehimpulses (Quantenzahl l) und die z-Komponente des Drehimpuls (Quantenzahl m). Diese drei Größen bilden dann einen vollständigen Satz kommutierender Observablen.\n",
        "Eine Menge von Observablen A, B, C,... bildet einen v.S.k.O., wenn eine orthonormale Basis des Zustandsraums aus gemeinsamen Eigenvektoren der Observablen existiert, und diese Basis (bis auf einen Phasenfaktor) eindeutig ist.\n",

In this study we demonstrate a device capable of beating the spin detection sensitivity of conventional spectrometers by many orders of magnitude. The performance matches previous demonstrations using superconducting quantum technologies, but importantly integrates the core components into a single device and works at higher magnetic fields and temperatures, which is critical for the practical use of this technology.

        "\n",
        "1. **Quantum Mechanics Basics**: To begin, a solid understanding of quantum mechanics is crucial. This includes understanding the principles of superposition, entanglement, quantum measurement, and the mathematical language of quantum mechanics (e.g., Dirac notation, Hilbert spaces, operators).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Qubits and Quantum Gates**: The fundamental unit of quantum information is the qubit, so understanding this concept is crucial. Along with this, it's important to understand quantum gates, which are the basic operations performed on qubits.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Quantum Circuits**: Quantum algorithms are typically depicted as quantum circuits. Understanding how these circuits work, how to construct them, and how to use them to implement quantum algorithms is key.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Quantum Algorithms**: There are several quantum algorithms that provide a speedup over classical algorithms (for certain types of problems). Some of the most famous include Shor's algorithm for factoring and Grover's algorithm for search.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerance**: Quantum information is very fragile, so learning how to protect it from errors is critical. This is where stabilizer codes and other quantum error correction codes come into play.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Quantum Entanglement and Bell's Theorem**: These are fundamental concepts in quantum information theory that have deep implications for the nature of quantum systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Quantum Cryptography and Quantum Communication**: Quantum mechanics offers new ways to secure communications, which is the focus of quantum cryptography.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Quantum Computing Hardware**: Understanding the physical systems used to implement quantum computers (like superconducting circuits, trapped ions, topological qubits, etc.) is also important.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for protecting quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Here's a high-level summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoding**: The first step in quantum error correction is to encode the quantum information. Rather than storing a quantum bit of information (a \"qubit\") in a single physical qubit, we store it in multiple physical qubits. This is done in such a way that, even if some of the physical qubits are corrupted by noise, the original quantum information can still be recovered. This encoding is done using a quantum error-correcting code. There are many different types of quantum error-correcting codes, each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syndrome measurement**: Once the quantum information has been encoded, the next step is to periodically check for errors. This is done by performing a syndrome measurement, which is a special kind of quantum measurement that can detect whether an error has occurred, and if so, what kind of error it was. Importantly, this measurement does not disturb the encoded quantum information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error correction**: If the syndrome measurement indicates that an error has occurred, the next step is to perform an error correction. This involves applying a series of quantum gates to the physical qubits to correct the error, based on the result of the syndrome measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Because quantum systems are always subject to noise, this process of syndrome measurement and error correction needs to be repeated periodically to keep the errors in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges: \n",
        "\n",
        "* It's worth noting that the whole process of quantum error correction requires a significant overhead in terms of additional physical qubits and quantum operations. This is a major challenge in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's also worth noting that, although quantum error correction can protect against many types of errors, it cannot protect against all possible errors. In particular, **it's assumed that the errors are relatively rare and do not all occur at once, and that they are independent and identically distributed across the physical qubits**. **If these assumptions are violated, then quantum error correction may not be able to correct the errors**. This is another major challenge in the field of quantum error correction."

Symmetry is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it refers to the idea that a physical system will remain unchanged under certain transformations. For example, the symmetry of a quantum system may be described by a group of rotations, translations, or reflections. Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system because they have the useful property of being commutative, meaning that the order in which the transformations are applied does not affect the outcome. This property makes it possible to use Abelian groups to describe the symmetries of a quantum system in a way that is mathematically tractable and easy to work with."

        " I am also frustrated by us and the media representing these anyon simulations as a \"step towards fault-tolerance\". Certainly topological codes are inspired by the physics of anyons and there are direct analogies between how those codes work and are realized and these simulations. I also have no doubt that certain aspects of these simulations have some degree of error robustness. But my understanding is that once you get serious about turning such simulations into a form of fault-tolerance appropriate for our devices and then try to optimize its realization you end up with the surface code. So while thinking about the physics of error-correction from this perspective might be useful and there are myriad mathematical similarities between what is going on in these simulations and topological codes, I think it is misleading/wrong to claim that performing these simulations is taking us any closer to fault-tolerance (whether the surface code or a different form of it). People keep telling me that I am misunderstanding this (and maybe I am!) but I have not been convinced of that yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "my objection, which might be different from Cody's, is that the title of this blog post suggests that this experiment is getting us closer to realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In particular, when we say it is a step closer to improved quantum computers, it makes it sound like this approach is somehow a step on our roadmap for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers, or that it is going to make our ultimate goal easier or something like that. That is reading between the lines a little bit, but it is how it sounds to me. Is that actually true? Or is this in the category of \"nice demonstration, but not something we're going to follow up on, and thus not a step towards us improving quantum computers other than in the very broad sense that it helps test hardware capabilities like most physics team experiments do\"? My understanding is that nothing about this experiment is likely to change anything about how we are planning to realize fault-tolerance. Maybe that is incorrect, or it is correct and I am just reading too much into the implications of statements like the title. It would be nice to understand this better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main sense in which the non-abelian anyons are useful for fault tolerance is that they are isomorphic to twists in the surface code, and you can use twists to store logical qubits. But we already knew about twists independent of this work e.g. from https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04673 so I don't know what it adds on the fault tolerance side.\n",
        "\n",
        "I did give a presentation to the authors of our abelian paper on how to do it fault tolerantly (they were technically \"using\" a surface code, but they were preparing it entirely unitarily which is not fault tolerant; you have to use measurements for everything). They weren't so interested I think, because the measurement version is harder and maybe also because they didn't consider it \"really doing it\" in the same way. I actually did run some quick shots of my versions of the circuits on the device back when pink was in M2 shape, and it worked, in that I got non-zero signal (the error rate was close to max but not max). I wasn't doing adept or etc or etc; if an experimentalist did it it would have been better. Also I now have much better versions of the circuit, which are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07395 .\n",
        "\n",
        "My point was that if you interpret TQC as broadly (\"you have things that act like anyons\") then this is demonstrating something interesting (multiparticle entangled EC state, FT gates on that state).  But I also agree with Ryan in that I think the blog post does not convey this well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fair enough, I'm just trying to put forth a perspective on why it is fine to say this is an interesting experiment in topological quantum computation.  And if you want some idea of how it might lead to noise protection, yes  https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912040 which was expanded upon in https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3988\n",
        "\n",

        "I think I agree with everything you've said Dave. But I don't think any of that really justifies the framing of the blog post title, which to me suggests that this is moving us closer to building a fault-tolerant quantum computer as opposed to exploring the error robustness of anyon simulation."

In fact, with collaborators we have proven that the color code is equivalent to a surface code (paper) up to a geometrically local unitary (one which only makes nearby qubits interact). One can think by analogy of the surface code* as a napkin with two rough and two smooth sides and the color code as folding this napkin along its diagonal. Because in the folded napkin, there are new things that are now close, it is possible to do more logical gates \"transversally\". This is good because it keeps errors from propagating and is relatively easy. However, the color code needs more qubits to interact in each stabilizer so ends up leading to a lower noise threshold. So one can say that although very similar, each code has its advantages and disadvantages.\n",
        "\n",

The Rainer Blatt group demonstrated the smallest possible color-code which also uses 7 qubits (this instance is also referred to as the Steane code).

        "\n",
        "Quantum circuits are primarily built using unitary operations (also known as quantum gates), but that's not the entire story. There are two other crucial components that are involved: measurements and initialization operations, which are not unitary.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Unitary Operations**: These are the most common operations performed in quantum circuits and they play a crucial role because they preserve the quantum mechanical property of preserving the sum of probabilities. They are reversible and their inverses are their adjoints. Examples include the Pauli X, Y, and Z gates, Hadamard gate, phase gate, CNOT gate, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Measurement Operations**: Measurements are another essential part of quantum circuits and they are not unitary. When a measurement is made, the quantum state collapses from a superposition of states to one particular state according to a certain probability distribution. This is a fundamentally irreversible process, and thus not unitary.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Initialization Operations**: When a quantum circuit starts, qubits are typically initialized to a certain state, most commonly the |0> state. This initialization is a non-unitary process as it doesn't conserve the previous information of the qubit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, in the real world, quantum systems experience noise and decoherence, which are also non-unitary processes. Error-correction techniques are implemented to deal with these issues, but they also cannot be modeled with unitary operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, while unitary operations are indeed a fundamental part of quantum circuits, they're not the only operations that can be implemented in a quantum circuit. Non-unitary operations like measurements and initializations also play an integral role in quantum computing."

        "\n",
        "In quantum computing, a universal gate set is a set of quantum gates from which any possible quantum operation can be constructed to any desired level of precision. A commonly used set of universal quantum gates consists of the set of all single-qubit gates and the CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CNOT gate along with single-qubit rotations (which can be formed from combinations of Hadamard gates and phase gates) allow us to generate a very large number of quantum states and operations. However, this set of gates isn't sufficient to create all possible quantum operations, which is a requirement for universality.\n",
        "\n",
        "The T-gate, which represents a π/8 rotation around the Z-axis on the Bloch sphere (or a phase shift of e^(iπ/4)), is commonly added to the gate set to make it universal. \n",
        "\n",
        "This is because the T-gate is a non-Clifford gate, and adding any non-Clifford gate to the set of Clifford gates (the Hadamard gate, phase gate, and CNOT gate are all Clifford gates) results in a universal gate set. The non-Clifford nature of the T-gate allows us to generate quantum operations that cannot be created from Clifford gates alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the T-gate is often added to the gate set in order to achieve universality, enabling the performance of any arbitrary quantum computation.\n",

        "It's worth mentioning that the T-gate isn't the only choice for completing the universal gate set. Other choices could be used as well, as long as they are non-Clifford. The T-gate, however, has properties that make it a convenient and commonly-used choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "**what are these properties?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The T-gate has a few properties that make it particularly convenient as a choice for completing a universal gate set:\n",

        "1. **It's a single-qubit gate**: This makes it relatively simple to implement compared to multi-qubit gates.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **It's a simple rotation**: The T-gate represents a π/8 (or 45 degrees) phase shift, which is a relatively simple operation compared to many other non-Clifford gates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Its matrix representation is simple**: The T-gate has a simple matrix representation, making it convenient for theoretical calculations and analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **It has a known fault-tolerant implementation**: There exists a known protocol for implementing the T-gate in a fault-tolerant manner using a procedure called magic state distillation. This is a crucial requirement for large-scale, error-corrected quantum computing. Although the process is resource-intensive, it's a well-studied method that allows the implementation of T-gates with an arbitrarily low error rate.\n",

        "[**Magic state distillation**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_state_distillation) is a procedure in quantum computation that is used to create high-fidelity quantum states, starting from several copies of a \"noisy\" state. The name \"distillation\" is used because it's similar to the idea of distilling a liquid to increase its purity. \n",
        "\n",
        "The technique was first proposed by Emanuel Knill in 2004, and further analyzed by Sergey Bravyi and Alexei Kitaev the same year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a high-level overview of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Preparation**: Prepare several copies of a quantum state. These states are typically \"noisy\" copies of a desired magic state, meaning they have some errors or deviations from the perfect magic state. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Error Detection**: Apply a quantum error-detecting code to these copies. This code is a series of quantum operations that can identify (but not correct) certain errors in the quantum states.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Measurement**: Measure the error-detecting code. This does not directly measure the quantum states themselves but measures whether an error has been detected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Post-selection**: If the measurement indicates that no errors were detected, then (due to the properties of quantum mechanics) the quantum states are projected into a state that is closer to the perfect magic state than the original states were. If an error was detected, discard the states and start over.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Repeat**: Repeat this process several times. Each time, the states get closer to the perfect magic state.\n",
        "\n",
        "By repeating this process, one can \"distill\" a set of noisy magic states into a smaller number of higher-fidelity magic states. This is a crucial part of many fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes, as it allows one to perform universal quantum computation even in the presence of noise."

        "\n",
        "1. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. The transformation is done in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (i.e., accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component, in turn, has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components. PCA is often used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models.\n",

Given a matrix A, you can decompose it into three matrices U, Σ, and V^T such that A = UΣV^T. The U and V matrices contain orthogonal vectors (the left and right singular vectors), and Σ contains the singular values, which can be thought of as the \"strength\" or \"importance\" of the corresponding singular vectors. The SVD is a fundamental operation in linear algebra, and it has a wide range of applications. It's used in solving systems of linear equations, inverting matrices, and is the backbone of many data reduction techniques.\n",

        "The relationship between PCA and SVD is as follows: PCA can be solved by applying the SVD on the data matrix (more precisely, on the covariance or correlation matrix of the data). The principal components resulting from PCA are equivalent to the right singular vectors resulting from the SVD (after some scaling). In other words, PCA can be considered a special case of SVD.\n",

Partially it’s true because you can do a lot of physics, even with underlying geometrical structure, without mentioning the geometry explicitly. On the other modern theoretical physics is using geometrical language in more and more areas. Sometimes it gives you really a new insight which is not seen without geometry, more often it is just an elegant way how to describe the things.\n",

The picture is that physical particles live in Euclidean space and each is described by three Cartesian coordinates. This already gives you larger configuration space which is 3N-dimensional, where N is the number of particles. However, if your particles are subject to constraints (e.g., particle can move only along a circle), you configuration space is reduced (e.g. to a circle, instead of Euclidean plane) and it is actually a submanifold of 3N-dimensional space. What you do in Lagrange’s formalism is that you write the equations of motion solely in terms of the coordinates on this submanifold.\n",
        "\n",
        "On this submanifold some interesting structures arise. The velocity of particle is tangent to the submanifold so it is useful to introduce the tangent bundle (i.e. set of all tangent spaces at each points of the submanifold) and Lagrangian mechanics can be geometrically formulated on this bundle. It even makes sense to introduce a metric: it is simply a metric induced by embedding of submanifold into Euclidean space. Physically, the norm of any vector of the tangent bundle is related to the kinetic energy.\n",

The structure of Hamilton’s equations can be reformulated in terms of the so-called symplectic form. Transformations preserving the form of Hamilton’s equations are called symplectomorphisms. The symplectic form plays the role of the metric, although it is antisymetric rather than symmetric and symplectic geometry (as opposed to Riemannian geometry) is a very interesting area. It gives you deeper insight into the Legendre transformation (which relates Lagrangian and Hamiltonian picture), for example.\n",

In quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, it is important to formulate the field equations which are compatible with equations of special relativity. In order to understand this in detail, you need a differential geometry and group theory. In this language, physical fields form a representation space for the Lorentz (Poincare) group. Representations of Lorentz group are labelled by spin (roughly), so for example spin 0 corresponds to particular representation of Lorentz group which gives you Klein-Gordon equation, similarly for spin 1 (Maxwell or Proca equations), and for spin 1/2, 3/2 (Dirac, Rarita-Schwinger). This is related to the next point.\n",

        "It turns out that physical fields have (beside the Lorentz invariance) also another symmetry known as the gauge symmetry. When you have a free field described by a Lagrangian and you want to let it interact with another field, requiring the gauge invariance you can derive more-less uniquely correct Lagrangian for interacting fields. This was discovered by physicists but later they realized that these gauge symmetries can be conveniently described in geometrical language. We understand the gauge symmetry as some kind of internal symmetry. To each point of the spacetime we attach a copy of the space (called fibre) representing the internal states at that point. Hence, we obtain a structure called principal G-bundle where G is the group acting on the fibres. The interaction between the two fields then arises as the covariant derivative on principal G-bundle. So, differential geometry is very efficient tool for studying these things.\n",

        "\n",
        "But it’s possible to say more than that. From reading popular articles, many people have the vague impression that a quantum computer could just try every possible solution in parallel. And if that’s all you know about them, then it’s indeed a mystery why they couldn’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time!\n",
        "\n",
        "The central difficulty is that, for a computer to be useful, at some point you need to measure it to observe an answer. And if you just measured an equal superposition over all possible answers, not having done anything else, the rules of QM dictate that you’ll just see a random answer. And of course, if you’d just wanted a random answer, you could’ve picked one yourself with a lot less trouble!\n",
        "\n",
        "So the name of the game, with every quantum algorithm, is somehow orchestrating a pattern of constructive and destructive quantum interference that boosts the probability of the correct answer (even though you yourself don’t know in advance which answer is the correct one!), and that does so efficiently. Famously, in 1994 Peter Shor showed how to do that for the problem of factoring integers, and a few related problems in number theory—but he was able to do so only by exploiting extremely special structure in those problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more “generic” search problems, like NP-complete problems, the best we generally know is Grover’s algorithm: a quantum algorithm that’s able to find the right answer (i.e., concentrate a large fraction of the amplitude on that answer) in roughly the square root of the number of steps that would be needed classically. So you get some speedup, but not an exponential one.\n",
        "\n",
        "But we also know that, if your search problem is a “black box”—i.e., you can just pick candidate solutions and evaluate if they’re correct, and you don’t know anything more about the problem’s structure—then Grover’s algorithm is the best that even a quantum computer can do. This is the content of the so-called BBBV (Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, Vazirani) Theorem, which has several proofs, all of them crucially relying on the linearity of unitary evolution. The BBBV Theorem gives a fundamental explanation for why any fast quantum algorithm for NP-complete problems would have to look very different from anything that we know today—much like a fast classical algorithm would have to*."

A common type of Markov chain with transient states is an absorbing one. An absorbing Markov chain is a Markov chain in which it is impossible to leave some states, and any state could (after some number of steps, with positive probability) reach such a state. It follows that all non-absorbing states in an absorbing Markov chain are transient."

        "  * This is also part of the reason a **cross-entropy loss is not usually used for metric learning tasks** like Face Verification — it doesn’t impose any constraints on the distribution on the model’s inner representation of the given data — i.e. the model can learn any features regardless of whether similar data points would be located closely to each other or not after the transformation.\n",
        "  * for each class/group of similar points (in case of Face Recognition task it would be all the photos of the same person) the **maximum intra-class distance is smaller than the minimum inter-class distance.**\n",

        "First, dropout is generally less effective at regularizing convolutional layers: The reason? Since convolutional layers have few parameters, they need less regularization to begin with. Furthermore, because of the spatial relationships encoded in feature maps, activations can become highly correlated. This renders dropout ineffective. ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5l3f1c/d_what_happened_to_dropout/))\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, what dropout is good at regularizing is becoming outdated: Large models like VGG16 included fully connected layers at the end of the network. For models like this, overfitting was combatted by including dropout between fully connected layers. Unfortunately, [recent architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) move away from this fully-connected block. By replacing dense layers with global average pooling, modern convnets have reduced model size while improving performance.\n",

        "* While ℓ 2 regularization is implemented with a clearly-defined penalty term, dropout requires a random process of “switching off” some units, which cannot be coherently expressed as a penalty term and therefore cannot be analyzed other than experimentally.\n",
        "* they both try to avoid the network’s over-reliance on spurious correlations, which are one of the consequences of overtraining that wreaks havoc with generalization. But more detailed research is necessary to determine whether and when they can “work together” or rather end up “fighting each other”. So far, it seems the results tend to vary in a case-by-case fashion. Using both can increase accuracy: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf (Hinton paper 2014)"

The gradients calculated with a small batch size are much more noisy than gradients calculated with large batch size, so it's easier for the model to escape from sharp minimizers, and thus leads to a better generalization. Generalization error is often best for a batch size of 1. Training with such a small batch size might require a small learning rate to maintain stability because of the high variance in the estimate of the gradient. The total runtime can be very high as a result of the need to make more steps, both because of the reduced learning rate and because it takes more steps to observe the entire training set.)\n",
