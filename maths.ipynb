        "\"There are (at least) two possible ways to formulate precisely (i.e. mathematically) elementary\n",
        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

For example, the 1-body reduced density matrix (also known as the one-particle density matrix) is often used in quantum chemistry to describe electron behavior in molecular systems."

It is essential for representing both superposition and entanglement in quantum computing. The tensor product generates a new vector in a larger Hilbert space that contains all pairwise products of the elements, unlike the dot product, which collapses vectors into a scalar, representing the degree of their parallelism. For example, if we have two qubits such that one qubit is in state $|0\\rangle$ and the second qubit is in state $|1\\rangle$, their combined state is represented by \\eq{tensorproduct}.

        "\n",
        "In **Pairwise Bell-State Entangling**, only the first qubit is put into a Hadamard superposition because this creates the necessary entanglement when followed by a **Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate**. Here's the reasoning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Creating Superposition with Hadamard**:\n",
        "   - The Hadamard gate applied to the first qubit creates a superposition:\n",
        "     $\n",
        "     H|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle).\n",

        "   - At this stage, the first qubit exists in a superposition of its basis states.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Entanglement via CNOT**:\n",
        "   - The **CNOT gate** uses the first qubit (control) to modify the state of the second qubit (target). If the first qubit is in a superposition, the CNOT gate spreads this superposition to the second qubit:\n",

        "$\\text{Input: } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle) \\otimes |0\\rangle$\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - Applying a Hadamard to the second qubit as well would be unnecessary because the desired entangled state can be achieved without it.\n",

In this video, we discuss how to describe such composite system in terms of its tensor product. We define the concept of separable versus entangled states in such composite two qubit system. We also explain how one can define a reduced density matrix for the subsystems, and from which a measure for the degree of entanglement can be established. We introduced the Bell states, which are two qubit states with maximum entanglement."

When measuring $\\rho$ using this POVM, the probability of outcome $j$ is given by $\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(M_j \\rho\\right)$, where $Tr$ denotes the trace operation - essentially a sum over the diagonal elements of matrix $M_j$.  It's important to note that unlike projective measurements, some POVMs may not necessarily cause the system to collapse into a specific state after the measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weak measurements$$ are a type of quantum measurement that partially collapse the quantum state, providing limited information while minimizing disturbance. This contrasts with strong measurements, which fully collapse the state.  Weak measurements are achieved by intentionally making the interaction between the system and the measuring device very weak. The measurement process transfers only a small amount of information from the system to the device, and the wave function of the quantum system is only slightly disturbed. This allows for extracting some information without significantly altering the system.\n",

Specifically, Holevo's bound states that the maximum amount of classical information accessible from a single qubit is one bit, even if the qubit was initially prepared in a complex superposition \\cite{621.391.1:535.14}. This emphasizes the difference between the potential information encoded within a quantum system and the information we can practically extract through classical measurements.\n",

U(1) is a mathematical group that represents a continuous symmetry associated with global phase transformations. We can outline how quantum field theory incorporates this symmetry to explain the concept:\n",

        "✅ Global U(1) Phase Symmetry:\n",
        "In quantum field theory, we work with fields and operators that are often complex-valued. The global U(1) phase symmetry refers to the ability to multiply the entire quantum state by a complex phase factor without affecting the physical observables. Mathematically, for a one-qubit system, the global U(1) phase transformation can be represented as follows:\n",

        "\n",
        "✅ No Observable Impact: The key feature of this global phase transformation is that it does not change the probabilities of measurement outcomes or any other physically observable quantities. The global phase is, in a sense, \"gauged out\" because it affects both the quantum state and its complex conjugate, so it cancels out in terms of probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Conservation of Probability: The conservation of probability is ensured by the U(1) phase symmetry. The probabilities of measuring a qubit in any state remain constant under global phase transformations. This property is closely related to the conservation of probability in quantum systems.\n",

        "✅ Interference and Relative Phases: While the global phase itself is not physically meaningful, relative phases between different quantum states are significant. Quantum field theory allows for interference effects, which arise from relative phases between states. This interference is crucial in understanding phenomena like quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.\n",

Vielmehr bezeichnen Physiker so jene Quantenberechnungen, die sich nicht mit gewöhnlichen Rechnern durchführen lassen. Allerdings sind solche »magischen Zustände« sehr aufwändig herzustellen. Wie ein Forschungsteam um den Physiker Pradeep Niroula von der University of Maryland nun in der Fachzeitschrift »Nature Physics« berichtet, können Fehler in bestimmten Qubit-Anordnungen magische Zustände erzeugen. Tatsächlich beobachteten die Forschenden eine Art Phasenübergang: Die Stärke der Fehler übernimmt dabei die Rolle der Temperatur und führt zu einem Übergang von »nichtmagischen« zu magischen Zuständen, die teilweise mit negativen Wahrscheinlichkeiten behaftet sind. »Die Quanteninformatik schreitet weiter voran und das Verständnis und die Nutzung der Magie wird der Schlüssel sein, um das volle Potenzial der Quantentechnologien zu erschließen«, schreibt der Physiker Xhek Turkeshi von der Universität zu Köln in einem bei »Nature« erschienenen Begleitartikel zur Forschungsarbeit.\n",

        "Neue Wirkstoffe, Wundermaterialien und ein tieferes Verständnis der Quantenwelt: Das sind nur einige der beeindruckenden Versprechungen von Quantencomputern. Im Gegensatz zu herkömmlichen Rechnern verarbeiten Quantencomputer quantenmechanische Informationseinheiten, so genannte Qubits. Diese können wie ihre klassischen Pendants die Werte eins und null annehmen – aber auch überlagerte Zustände aufweisen, bei denen sie beispielsweise mit 60-prozentiger Wahrscheinlichkeit null und mit 40-prozentiger eins sind. Zudem können Qubits durch eine Art unsichtbares Band selbst über große Distanzen hinweg untrennbar miteinander verbunden sein; ein Quantenphänomen, das als Verschränkung bekannt ist. Die seltsamen Regeln der Quantenmechanik ermöglichen es, völlig neue Arten von Berechnungen durchzuführen – und so einige Probleme zu lösen, die für gewöhnliche Rechner unerreichbar sind.\n",
        "\n",
        "**»Oft wird behauptet, das Besondere an Quantencomputern seien die Überlagerung und die Verschränkung, aber das stimmt so nicht ganz«, schrieb die Physikerin Zaira Nazario vom IBM Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, in einem »Spektrum«-Artikel. Tatsächlich können viele Quantenberechnungen effizient durch klassische Computer simuliert werden. Hierbei unterscheiden Quanteninformationstheoretiker zwei Arten von Qubit-Operationen: so genannte Clifford-Gatter und Nicht-Clifford-Gatter. Beide können die Quanteninformationseinheiten überlagern oder miteinander verschränken. Erstere sind einfacher umzusetzen – mit ihnen lassen sich aber nur Berechnungen durchführen, die auch klassische Computer bewältigen können. Damit bieten sie keinen Vorteil. »Für sich genommen können sie keinen universellen Quantencomputer bilden, da sie nicht alle möglichen Quantenzustände erzeugen können«, schreibt Xhek Turkeshi.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Tatsächlich können Quantencomputer ihre gesamte Kraft erst entfalten, wenn sie Nicht-Clifford-Gatter enthalten. Diese entsprechen jenen Operationen, die nicht effizient durch gewöhnliche Rechner simuliert werden können; etwa die Vertauschung zweier Qubits oder die Änderung der Phase um π/4. Die berühmtesten Quantenalgorithmen wie der Shor-Algorithmus (der es Quantencomputern ermöglichen könnte, große Zahlen schnell in ihre Primteiler zu zerlegen) greifen in der Regel immer auf solche Operationen zurück. »In Quantencomputern lassen sich Nicht-Clifford-Gatter einfach umsetzen«, schreiben die Forschenden um Pradeep Niroula in ihrer Arbeit. Die Situation sieht allerdings anders aus, wenn man Quantenfehlerkorrekturen miteinbezieht.\n",

        "Fehler loswerden\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantencomputer haben einen entscheidenden Nachteil: Sie sind extrem empfindlich. Kleinste Umwelteinflüsse wie Erschütterungen oder Temperaturschwankungen können die Quantenzustände der Qubits zerstören und Fehler erzeugen. Daher sind Algorithmen zur Fehlerkorrektur für verlässliche Berechnungen unverzichtbar. Dabei verteilt man die Quanteninformation auf mehrere »physische« Qubits (zum Beispiel die Ionen oder die supraleitenden Schaltkreise, je nach Art des Quantencomputers) und codiert damit ein einzelnes »logisches« Qubit. Solche Algorithmen erhöhen also die Anzahl der benötigten Quanteninformationseinheiten.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clifford-Gatter lassen sich mit Quantenfehlerkorrekturen einfach verbinden: Diese Gatter verarbeiten die vielen physischen Qubits, aus denen ein einzelnes logisches Qubits besteht, individuell. »Daher bleibt die Fehlerrate immer gleich und somit unter Kontrolle«, schrieb Zaira Nazario. »Das ist eine nützliche Eigenschaft, die verhindert, dass sich große Rechnungen nicht mehr bewältigen lassen.« Anders ist es hingegen bei Nicht-Clifford-Gattern. Wenn Fehler auftreten, lassen sich diese Gatter viel schwieriger korrigieren; sie sind so empfindlich, dass schon der kleinste Fehler bei diesen Operationen eine ganze Berechnung zunichtemachen kann. Doch Physikerinnen und Physiker haben einen Ausweg gefunden: Magie.\n",
        "\n",
        "»Die komplizierten Nicht-Clifford-Gatter werden dabei durch Qubits ersetzt, die sich in einem magischen Zustand befinden«, schrieb Nazario. »Diese codieren dann die Wirkung der Nicht-Clifford-Operationen.« Indem man also solche magischen Zustände mit Clifford-Gattern verbindet, lassen sich theoretisch fehlertolerante Quantencomputer realisieren. Theoretisch. Denn die magischen Zustände reagieren nicht nur extrem empfindlich auf äußere Einflüsse, sondern sind auch in der Herstellung sehr aufwändig. In der Regel muss man sehr viele fehlerbehaftete magische Zustände herstellen und dann daraus die »reinsten« extrahieren.\n",
        "\n",
        "»Das Verständnis der Mechanismen, durch die Magie erzeugt oder zerstört wird, ist ein wichtiger Schritt auf dem Weg zu einer effizienten und praktischen fehlertoleranten Berechnung«, schreibt das Team um Niroula. Deshalb haben sie das Phänomen genauer unter die Lupe genommen. Die Fachleute griffen dafür nicht nur auf computergestützte Simulationen zurück, sondern setzten ihre Überlegungen auch in einem 32 Qubits umfassenden Quantencomputer mit Ionenfallen um.\n",
        "\n",
        "Die Fachleute haben dafür eine bestimmte Art von Fehlerkorrektur genutzt, so genannte zufällige Stabilisierungscodes. In diesen erfolgt die Codierung und Decodierung der Quanteninformation innerhalb eines logischen Qubits durch zufällig gewählte Clifford-Gatter mit wenigen magischen Zuständen. Die Forschenden speisten daraufhin gezielt bestimmte Fehler in das System ein, welche die Quantenzustände nicht direkt zerstören (so wird etwa die Überlagerung eines Qubits verändert). Das Team untersuchte, wie sich diese Fehler auf die Magie des logischen Quantenzustands auswirken.\n",
        "\n",
        "Um die Magie zu vermessen, schauten sich die Physikerinnen und Physiker die Entropie des Systems an, deren Werte einer Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung folgen. Im Gegensatz zu gewöhnlichen Wahrscheinlichkeiten kann sie in diesem Fall auch negative Werte annehmen. »Diese Negativität ist wichtig«, erklärt Niroula auf X (Article\n",

Dass die Quantenphysik den gewöhnlichen Regeln der Wahrscheinlichkeitslehre widerspricht, ist nicht neu: Es kommt manchmal vor, dass Quantenzustände »Pseudowahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen« folgen, die teilweise negative Werte haben können.\n",
        "\n",
        "Die Fachleute stellten fest, dass der Quantenzustand des logischen Qubits durch kleine Fehler nach Ausführen des Stabilisierungscodes wenig Magie enthält – so wie vor dem Anwenden des Codes. »Starke Fehler führen hingegen zu umfangreicher Magie im logischen Zustand«, schreibt Xhek Turkeshi. Wie das Forschungsteam herausfand, gleicht der Verlauf der Magie eines Systems bei Erhöhung der Fehler einem Phasenübergang, ähnlich wie der Übergang eines Festkörpers zu einer Flüssigkeit, wenn die Temperatur steigt.\n",
        "\n",
        "»Das Ergebnis verdeutlicht einmal mehr, wie schwierig es ist, zu bestimmen, was etwas zu einem ›Quant‹ macht«\n",
        "Xhek Turkeshi, Physiker\n",
        "\n",
        "Damit haben Niroula und seine Kollegen und Kolleginnen einen neuen Weg gefunden, um magische Zustände zu erzeugen. »Allerdings beruht dieser Zustand auf zufälligen Fehlern und unterliegt damit nicht der Kontrolle des Experimentators«, schreibt Turkeshi. »Die Herausforderung besteht darin, den Zustand in einen Zustand zu verwandeln, der für Quantenberechnungen nützlich ist.« Dies könne gelingen, wenn man andere Stabilisierungscodes betrachtet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dennoch betont der Physiker, dass die neueste Arbeit der Forschenden überaus wichtig ist. »Das Ergebnis von Niroula und Kollegen verdeutlicht einmal mehr, wie schwierig es ist, zu bestimmen, was etwas zu einem ›Quant‹ macht. Vor einem Jahrhundert, bei der Geburt der Quantenmechanik, war diese Frage eine philosophische, aber jetzt ist sie mit Messungen untersuchbar.«\n"

        "In quantum computing, a universal gate set is a set of quantum gates from which any possible quantum operation can be constructed to any desired level of precision. A commonly used set of universal quantum gates consists of the set of all single-qubit gates and the CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate.\n",

        "The CNOT gate along with single-qubit rotations (which can be formed from combinations of Hadamard gates and phase gates) allow us to generate a very large number of quantum states and operations. However, this set of gates isn't sufficient to create all possible quantum operations, which is a requirement for universality.\n",
        "\n",
        "The T-gate, which represents a π/8 rotation around the Z-axis on the Bloch sphere (or a phase shift of e^(iπ/4)), is commonly added to the gate set to make it universal.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is because the T-gate is a non-Clifford gate, and adding any non-Clifford gate to the set of Clifford gates (the Hadamard gate, phase gate, and CNOT gate are all Clifford gates) results in a universal gate set. The non-Clifford nature of the T-gate allows us to generate quantum operations that cannot be created from Clifford gates alone.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Its matrix representation is simple**: The T-gate has a simple matrix representation, making it convenient for theoretical calculations and analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **It has a known fault-tolerant implementation**: There exists a known protocol for implementing the T-gate in a fault-tolerant manner using a procedure called magic state distillation. This is a crucial requirement for large-scale, error-corrected quantum computing. Although the process is resource-intensive, it's a well-studied method that allows the implementation of T-gates with an arbitrarily low error rate.\n",

        "1. **Preparation**: Prepare several copies of a quantum state. These states are typically \"noisy\" copies of a desired magic state, meaning they have some errors or deviations from the perfect magic state.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Error Detection**: Apply a quantum error-detecting code to these copies. This code is a series of quantum operations that can identify (but not correct) certain errors in the quantum states.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Measurement**: Measure the error-detecting code. This does not directly measure the quantum states themselves but measures whether an error has been detected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Post-selection**: If the measurement indicates that no errors were detected, then (due to the properties of quantum mechanics) the quantum states are projected into a state that is closer to the perfect magic state than the original states were. If an error was detected, discard the states and start over.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Repeat**: Repeat this process several times. Each time, the states get closer to the perfect magic state.\n",
        "\n",
        "By repeating this process, one can \"distill\" a set of noisy magic states into a smaller number of higher-fidelity magic states. This is a crucial part of many fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes, as it allows one to perform universal quantum computation even in the presence of noise."

While the classical Lanczos method has exponential cost in the system size to represent the Krylov states for quantum systems, our efficient quantum algorithm achieves this in polynomial time and memory. The construction presented is exact in the sense that the resulting Krylov space is identical to that of the Lanczos method, so the only approximation with respect to the exact method is due to finite sample noise. This is possible because, unlike previous quantum Krylov methods, our algorithm does not require simulating real or imaginary time evolution. We provide an explicit error bound for the resulting ground state energy estimate in the presence of noise.\n",

        "Shadow tomography, also known as X-ray phase-contrast imaging or phase tomography, is a technique used to create detailed three-dimensional images of an object's internal structure. It is primarily employed in the field of medical imaging but also finds applications in materials science and other areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional X-ray imaging relies on the attenuation of X-rays as they pass through different tissues or materials, resulting in a two-dimensional projection image that shows variations in X-ray absorption. However, some tissues or materials have similar absorption properties, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on their attenuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography overcomes this limitation by exploiting the phase shift of X-rays as they pass through an object. When X-rays encounter a boundary between two materials with different refractive indices, they undergo a phase shift. This phase shift contains valuable information about the object's internal structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform shadow tomography, a coherent X-ray source, such as a synchrotron or an X-ray tube, is used. The X-rays pass through the object and are collected by a detector placed behind it. The collected X-rays contain both intensity and phase information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to shadow tomography lies in extracting the phase information from the intensity measurements. This is typically achieved by using specialized techniques such as interferometry or grating-based methods. These methods create interference patterns that encode the phase information, which can then be computationally reconstructed into a three-dimensional image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting shadow tomography image provides not only information about the X-ray absorption but also about the object's refractive index distribution and other structural features. This enables visualization of fine details, such as boundaries between tissues or subtle density variations, which may not be easily distinguishable in traditional X-ray images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance our understanding of complex biological and materials systems. However, it currently requires advanced X-ray sources and specialized techniques, limiting its widespread availability in clinical settings. Nevertheless, ongoing research and technological advancements aim to make shadow tomography more accessible and applicable in various fields."

By transforming to imaginary time, the calculations of quantum mechanics often become calculations in statistical mechanics. This is utilized in the technique called \"path integral formulation,\" where the evolution of a system in imaginary time makes the system go to its lowest energy state or the ground state.\n",

        "**Most Suitable Loss Functions for Quantum Diffusion Models:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Quantum Optimal Transport (QOT) Loss:** This is arguably the *most* promising approach.  QOT, especially with the Wasserstein distance, is well-suited for comparing probability distributions, which is precisely what you're doing in a diffusion model.  It's robust to differences in support (where the distributions have non-zero probability) and handles mixed states efficiently.  This makes it a strong candidate for quantum diffusion where you're dealing with evolving mixed states.  It directly addresses the core challenge of comparing the evolving distribution of your quantum system with the target distribution.\n",

        "2. **KL Divergence (or Quantum Relative Entropy):**  KL divergence is a classic choice for generative models, and quantum diffusion models fall into this category. The quantum relative entropy is the correct generalization for quantum states.  It measures the \"distance\" between two quantum states (density matrices).  However, it can be sensitive to situations where one distribution has a larger support than the other (e.g., when the model generates states the target distribution never occupies).  This can be a challenge in the early stages of training.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Stochastic Objective Function:**  The expectation values measured from a quantum computer are inherently noisy due to the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements.  This means the \"loss surface\" you're trying to navigate is not smooth but rather noisy and potentially riddled with local minima.  This stochasticity makes traditional gradient-based optimization methods, which assume smooth gradients, less reliable.  Think of trying to find the bottom of a bowl while someone is constantly shaking it.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Gradient Estimation:** Calculating gradients for QML models often involves estimating derivatives of expectation values.  Common methods like the parameter shift rule or finite difference methods introduce further noise and can be computationally expensive.  This noisy gradient information makes optimization even harder.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **High Dimensionality:** QML models can have a large number of parameters, especially as the complexity of the quantum circuits increases.  This high-dimensional parameter space makes optimization more challenging, as the number of local minima and saddle points can grow exponentially.\n",

        "1. **Gradient-Based Methods (with modifications):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **Adam/BFGS:** While standard Adam and BFGS can be used, they are sensitive to noise.  Consider using *component-wise* adaptive learning rates (like in Adam) where the learning rate for each parameter is adjusted individually based on its estimated gradient.  This can help navigate noisy landscapes.\n",
        "   * **Backtracking Line Search:**  Traditional backtracking line search, which relies on precise function evaluations to determine step size, is less effective in QML due to noise.  Alternatives like *stochastic line search* or simply smaller, more conservative learning rates are often preferred.\n",

It estimates the gradient by perturbing all parameters simultaneously, making it more robust to noise than finite difference methods.  SPSA is a key algorithm in QML.\n",
        "   * **Other Derivative-Free Optimization:**  Methods like Nelder-Mead or other evolutionary algorithms can also be employed, but they can be computationally expensive, especially in high-dimensional spaces.\n",

        "   * **Parameter Shift Rule:** This method provides an analytical way to compute gradients of expectation values in certain quantum circuits. While elegant, it can still be noisy in practice and sometimes requires careful circuit design.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Robust Optimization Practices:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Careful tuning of hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) is essential.  Since the objective function is stochastic, hyperparameters that work well in one run might not work well in another.  Consider using techniques like Bayesian optimization or grid search, but be mindful of the computational cost.\n",
        "   * **Restarts:** Due to the presence of many local minima, it's often beneficial to run the optimization multiple times with different initial parameter values (restarts).  This increases the chances of finding a better minimum.\n",
        "   * **Mixing and Matching:** Combining different optimization techniques can be helpful.  For example, you might use a gradient-free method like SPSA in the early stages of optimization to get close to a minimum and then switch to a gradient-based method with a smaller learning rate for fine-tuning (if the noise level allows).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Advanced Techniques:**\n",

        "**In summary:** QML optimization requires a different approach than classical optimization.  Dealing with noise, high dimensionality, and the specific characteristics of quantum gradients necessitates specialized techniques like SPSA, component-wise adaptive methods, and careful hyperparameter tuning.  The field is still actively developing, and new and improved optimization methods for QML are constantly being researched.\n"

        "**How does quantum error correction work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for protecting quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Here's a high-level summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoding**: The first step in quantum error correction is to encode the quantum information. Rather than storing a quantum bit of information (a \"qubit\") in a single physical qubit, we store it in multiple physical qubits. This is done in such a way that, even if some of the physical qubits are corrupted by noise, the original quantum information can still be recovered. This encoding is done using a quantum error-correcting code. There are many different types of quantum error-correcting codes, each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syndrome measurement**: Once the quantum information has been encoded, the next step is to periodically check for errors. This is done by performing a syndrome measurement, which is a special kind of quantum measurement that can detect whether an error has occurred, and if so, what kind of error it was. Importantly, this measurement does not disturb the encoded quantum information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error correction**: If the syndrome measurement indicates that an error has occurred, the next step is to perform an error correction. This involves applying a series of quantum gates to the physical qubits to correct the error, based on the result of the syndrome measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Because quantum systems are always subject to noise, this process of syndrome measurement and error correction needs to be repeated periodically to keep the errors in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's worth noting that the whole process of quantum error correction requires a significant overhead in terms of additional physical qubits and quantum operations. This is a major challenge in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's also worth noting that, although quantum error correction can protect against many types of errors, it cannot protect against all possible errors. In particular, **it's assumed that the errors are relatively rare and do not all occur at once, and that they are independent and identically distributed across the physical qubits**. **If these assumptions are violated, then quantum error correction may not be able to correct the errors**. This is another major challenge in the field of quantum error correction."

Symmetry is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it refers to the idea that a physical system will remain unchanged under certain transformations. For example, the symmetry of a quantum system may be described by a group of rotations, translations, or reflections. Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system because they have the useful property of being commutative, meaning that the order in which the transformations are applied does not affect the outcome. This property makes it possible to use Abelian groups to describe the symmetries of a quantum system in a way that is mathematically tractable and easy to work with."

Suppose you keep the circuit depth constant at, say, a relatively shallow three layers, as you increase the number of qubits. You won’t get much entanglement, and the output will still be amenable to classical simulation. On the other hand, if you increase the circuit depth to keep up with the growing number of qubits, the cumulative effects of gate errors will wash out the entanglement, and the output will again become easy to simulate classically."

        " I am also frustrated by us and the media representing these anyon simulations as a \"step towards fault-tolerance\". Certainly topological codes are inspired by the physics of anyons and there are direct analogies between how those codes work and are realized and these simulations. I also have no doubt that certain aspects of these simulations have some degree of error robustness. But my understanding is that once you get serious about turning such simulations into a form of fault-tolerance appropriate for our devices and then try to optimize its realization you end up with the surface code. So while thinking about the physics of error-correction from this perspective might be useful and there are myriad mathematical similarities between what is going on in these simulations and topological codes, I think it is misleading/wrong to claim that performing these simulations is taking us any closer to fault-tolerance (whether the surface code or a different form of it). People keep telling me that I am misunderstanding this (and maybe I am!) but I have not been convinced of that yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "my objection, which might be different from Cody's, is that the title of this blog post suggests that this experiment is getting us closer to realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In particular, when we say it is a step closer to improved quantum computers, it makes it sound like this approach is somehow a step on our roadmap for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers, or that it is going to make our ultimate goal easier or something like that. That is reading between the lines a little bit, but it is how it sounds to me. Is that actually true? Or is this in the category of \"nice demonstration, but not something we're going to follow up on, and thus not a step towards us improving quantum computers other than in the very broad sense that it helps test hardware capabilities like most physics team experiments do\"? My understanding is that nothing about this experiment is likely to change anything about how we are planning to realize fault-tolerance. Maybe that is incorrect, or it is correct and I am just reading too much into the implications of statements like the title. It would be nice to understand this better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main sense in which the non-abelian anyons are useful for fault tolerance is that they are isomorphic to twists in the surface code, and you can use twists to store logical qubits. But we already knew about twists independent of this work e.g. from https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04673 so I don't know what it adds on the fault tolerance side.\n",
        "\n",
        "I did give a presentation to the authors of our abelian paper on how to do it fault tolerantly (they were technically \"using\" a surface code, but they were preparing it entirely unitarily which is not fault tolerant; you have to use measurements for everything). They weren't so interested I think, because the measurement version is harder and maybe also because they didn't consider it \"really doing it\" in the same way. I actually did run some quick shots of my versions of the circuits on the device back when pink was in M2 shape, and it worked, in that I got non-zero signal (the error rate was close to max but not max). I wasn't doing adept or etc or etc; if an experimentalist did it it would have been better. Also I now have much better versions of the circuit, which are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07395 .\n",
        "\n",
        "My point was that if you interpret TQC as broadly (\"you have things that act like anyons\") then this is demonstrating something interesting (multiparticle entangled EC state, FT gates on that state).  But I also agree with Ryan in that I think the blog post does not convey this well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fair enough, I'm just trying to put forth a perspective on why it is fine to say this is an interesting experiment in topological quantum computation.  And if you want some idea of how it might lead to noise protection, yes  https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912040 which was expanded upon in https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3988\n",
        "\n",
        "And indeed our own team's work investigating how simulations of many body systems are related does or does not give protection of topologically protected information is in this direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "I think I agree with everything you've said Dave. But I don't think any of that really justifies the framing of the blog post title, which to me suggests that this is moving us closer to building a fault-tolerant quantum computer as opposed to exploring the error robustness of anyon simulation."

In fact, with collaborators we have proven that the color code is equivalent to a surface code (paper) up to a geometrically local unitary (one which only makes nearby qubits interact). One can think by analogy of the surface code* as a napkin with two rough and two smooth sides and the color code as folding this napkin along its diagonal. Because in the folded napkin, there are new things that are now close, it is possible to do more logical gates \"transversally\". This is good because it keeps errors from propagating and is relatively easy. However, the color code needs more qubits to interact in each stabilizer so ends up leading to a lower noise threshold. So one can say that although very similar, each code has its advantages and disadvantages.\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point, only very small versions of either of these codes are being demonstrated. The Rainer Blatt group demonstrated the smallest possible color-code which also uses 7 qubits (this instance is also referred to as the Steane code).

        "This paper is amazing. It touches exactly what I proposed as one of our (later) next steps: can we compare empirical conjugate pairs (as entangled incoming photons) with entangled sensors from quantum interferometry, and then even combine both approaches. This could give us the level of sensor advantage we can sue for exoplanets :D Let me just think a bit more where an advantage could come from (e.g. global correlation like a shared background drift or global constraints), or same accuracy but using a single qubit to do single copy sequential sensing. Also algebraically I want to think a but more about differences and bridges, to be safe on the theory side, that is, your conjugate pair paper roots in Weyl-Heisenberg group and its symplectic extensions in phase space (Wigner), meanwhile this paper operate more in the Hilbert space tensor structure rather than phase space. Our advantage in sensing (for our Heisenberg limit) comes from interference in global phase accumulation, rather than covariance under translations like in your paper. Sooo, algebraically these are different representations and information channel and we need to think how to bridge them. I don’t know, for example construct an interferometer which internal states are conjugate-paired or we interprete entangled state sensing via a symplectic phase-space embedding or so.. I definitely think this would be the next level of quantum photon sensing, but requires a bit more thinking. We can talk later if you think this is a worthwhile path :)\n"

        "From Appendix A of the paper:\n",
        "- These are defined as $ D_{q,p} = e^{i\\pi qp/d} X^q Z^p $.\n",
        "- They form an orthogonal basis of the operator space (like a generalized Pauli basis).\n",
        "- Importantly, they are **unitary**, but **not Hermitian** in general.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, while they provide a convenient basis, you **cannot directly measure** them or define physical observables from them without a modification—**because quantum measurements correspond to Hermitian operators.**\n",

        "In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. This concept is important because it provides insight into the structure of the matrix, its null space, column space, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "A \"low-rank\" matrix is a matrix where the rank is significantly less than the number of rows or columns. For example, if you have a 1000x1000 matrix (which could potentially have a rank up to 1000), but its rank is only 10, that matrix would be considered low-rank.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-rank matrices are useful in many applications, including machine learning and data analysis. They are often used in techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or singular value decomposition (SVD), where a high-dimensional dataset is approximated by a lower-dimensional one. This is possible because the data can often be accurately represented in a lower-dimensional space (i.e., with a low-rank matrix), which simplifies analysis and reduces computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of quantum computing, low-rank matrices are often easier to work with because they require fewer quantum resources to implement in quantum algorithms. For example, certain operations might require a number of qubits proportional to the rank of a matrix, meaning low-rank matrices can be more efficiently processed on a quantum computer."

        "\n",
        "The condition number of a matrix in linear algebra is a measure of the matrix's sensitivity to numerical errors. This number is used in the context of numerical analysis to understand the stability of a problem, specifically in the context of linear systems of equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The condition number is calculated as the ratio of the largest singular value of a matrix to the smallest singular value. In other words, it gives us a measure of how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a matrix has a low condition number, it means the matrix is well-conditioned, implying that the system of equations has a unique solution, and this solution can be found accurately by numerical methods. The solution will not significantly change even if the input is perturbed slightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if the condition number is high, the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. This indicates that the system is sensitive to small changes in the input, and even a slight change in the input could produce a large change in the result. Thus, the solution may not be accurately computable due to rounding errors and other numerical errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "So a low condition number in linear algebra is generally a good thing, as it indicates a stable and accurate system."

        "\n",
        "Generally, a matrix with a condition number close to 1 is considered to be well-conditioned, which means that it is not sensitive to changes in the input values. As the condition number increases, the matrix becomes increasingly ill-conditioned.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a rough rule of thumb, if the condition number κ(A) exceeds 1/ε, where ε is the machine precision (around 10^-16 for double-precision floating-point arithmetic), then the matrix is considered ill-conditioned. This is because the precision of the numerical computations might be less than the number of digits in the condition number. For example, a condition number of 10^12 would indicate that up to 12 digits of precision could be lost in the computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, condition numbers in the range of 1-10 are generally considered good, 10-100 might be cause for some concern, and 100+ is usually considered problematic, although these thresholds are rather arbitrary and can depend heavily on the specific context and precision of the computations.\n",

Von allen Kurven zwischen A und B minimiert eine den Ausdruck, der die Zeit des Durchlaufens der Kurve beschreibt. Dieser Ausdruck ist ein Integral, das die unbekannte, gesuchte Funktion, die die Kurve von A nach B beschreibt, und deren Ableitungen enthält."
