        "2.  **Data Encoding:** The encoding of financial data into quantum states is crucial. The example uses a simple angle encoding, but more sophisticated techniques like amplitude encoding or qubitization are often used in practice.\n",

        "  * Implement actual quantum optimization algorithms (e.g., VQE).\n",
        "  * Incorporate more realistic risk models.\n",
