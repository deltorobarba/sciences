The formulation of this classical-quantum analogy allows us to probe the root cause of why backpropagation scaling is so difficult to obtain in the quantum variational setting: The origin of the challenge lies within quantum measurement collapse and the inability to read out intermediate states while continuing a computation, rather than the probabilistic formulation of the problem.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Backpropagation scaling\" usually refers to techniques that manage the magnitudes of gradients during the process of backpropagation, which is used to train neural networks. Proper scaling is important because it can impact the speed and effectiveness of learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are two common scaling issues that may arise during backpropagation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Vanishing gradients:** When deep neural networks are trained, gradients of the loss function can become very small. As a result, weight updates during training become insignificant, and the network takes a very long time to learn, if it can learn at all. This problem is particularly common with activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent, which squish a large input space into a small output range.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exploding gradients:** Conversely, gradients can also become very large, leading to large updates to the weights and causing the model to oscillate around the optimal solution, or even to diverge entirely. This is often a problem in recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate these issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Gradient clipping:** This is a common technique to prevent exploding gradients. If the norm of the gradient exceeds a certain threshold, we scale it back to prevent it from getting too large.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Weight initialization:** Properly initializing the weights can prevent gradients from vanishing or exploding too quickly. For example, Xavier/Glorot and He initialization are strategies that consider the sizes of the input and output layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Choice of activation function:** The choice of activation function can help alleviate the vanishing gradients problem. For example, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants (like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU) are commonly used because they do not saturate for positive inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer to prevent the distribution of inputs to each layer from changing too much during training, which can help mitigate both vanishing and exploding gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use of optimizers:** Certain optimization algorithms like RMSProp, Adam, and Nadam can adaptively scale learning rates to mitigate both exploding and vanishing gradients.\n",

        "\n",
        "Backpropagation, the algorithm used to optimize the parameters of a neural network in classical machine learning, relies on efficiently computing gradients of a cost function with respect to the network parameters. This is done by propagating errors backwards through the network, layer by layer, hence the name \"backpropagation\".\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to quantum machine learning, where we deal with quantum data and quantum systems, the concept of backpropagation doesn't translate straightforwardly due to fundamental differences between classical and quantum systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some reasons why backpropagation may not easily scale in quantum machine learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Non-commutativity of operators**: Quantum operations, unlike classical ones, are represented by operators that generally do not commute, meaning the order in which they are applied matters. This non-commutativity makes the computation of gradients more complex than in the classical case.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Measurement**: In quantum mechanics, obtaining information about the state of a system involves measurement, which is a probabilistic process that collapses the state of the system. The inherent randomness of measurement makes the direct application of backpropagation problematic.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Complexity of quantum states**: Quantum states live in a complex vector space and can exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously, further complicating the process of backpropagation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Barren plateaus**: In the context of variational quantum algorithms, it's been found that the cost function landscape often suffers from the problem of \"barren plateaus\", where the function is flat almost everywhere. This makes it difficult for gradient-based methods like backpropagation to find a direction to move in to improve the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these challenges, researchers have developed quantum versions of backpropagation, such as the parameter-shift rule and the adjoint method, which are used to compute gradients of quantum circuits. However, these methods often require additional quantum resources, making it difficult to scale them up to larger quantum systems. New methods and strategies to overcome these issues are an active area of research in quantum machine learning."

        "\n",
        "1. **Parameter-shift rule**: This rule allows the derivative of a quantum circuit output with respect to its parameters to be computed in terms of circuit evaluations. Given a parameterized quantum gate (say, a rotation gate), the derivative of the expectation value of an observable with respect to the parameter can be computed as the difference between the expectation values of the observable for two slightly different values of the parameter. These \"shifted\" parameter values are typically chosen to be a small positive or negative shift from the original parameter value.\n",
        "\n",
        "    The parameter-shift rule is powerful because it allows us to compute exact gradients using only additional evaluations of the quantum circuit, with no need for complex computations involving the inner workings of the quantum operations. This makes it well-suited to hardware implementations, as the additional circuit evaluations can be run on the quantum device.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Adjoint method**: The adjoint method, also known as the reverse-mode differentiation, is a technique borrowed from classical automatic differentiation, generalized to the context of quantum circuits. It involves running the quantum circuit forward, storing the state at each step, and then running a modified version of the circuit backward to calculate the derivatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "   This method is efficient in terms of the number of quantum operations required, especially for circuits with many parameters but a single output (as is common in quantum machine learning models). However, it requires the ability to run quantum operations in reverse, as well as the ability to store quantum states, which can be challenging to implement on near-term quantum devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both methods are valuable tools for training variational quantum algorithms, where we seek to optimize the parameters of a quantum circuit to minimize a certain cost function. The choice between the two methods depends on factors like the specific structure of the quantum circuit, the capabilities of the quantum hardware, and the number of parameters versus the number of outputs."

        "The formal definition of the fat-shattering dimension is a bit technical, but here's the general idea: suppose you have a class of functions, and you want to understand how complex this class is. One way of doing this is to look at how these functions can separate or \"shatter\" sets of points. If you can find large sets of points that can be arbitrarily labeled (i.e., \"shattered\") by functions in your class, then the class has high complexity.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"power\" of a machine learning model can be interpreted in a few different ways, depending on the context, but it generally refers to the model's ability to learn from data and make accurate predictions. Here are a few specific interpretations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Expressive Power**: This relates to the complexity of the functions or relationships a model can learn. For example, a linear regression model has less expressive power than a neural network because it can only model linear relationships between inputs and outputs, while neural networks can model complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Predictive Power**: This refers to the model's ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data. A powerful model in this sense would have a high predictive accuracy. However, it's important to be aware of overfitting, where a model might have high predictive power on training data but performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generalization Power**: This refers to the model's ability to perform well on unseen data, which has not been used during the training process. It's a key factor in creating a machine learning model because we usually want a model that not only performs well on the training data, but also generalizes well to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Capacity**: The model's capacity can also be considered its power. A model with a large number of parameters might have high capacity (and therefore, potentially, more \"power\"), as it can fit a wide range of functions. But again, models with high capacity risk overfitting the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Robustness**: A powerful model is often expected to be robust, meaning it can handle noise in the data, outliers, or slight variations in the input, and still produce reliable and accurate results.\n",

        "Remember that increasing a model's power isn't always beneficial. While powerful models can learn complex patterns, they can also overfit to the training data and fail to generalize to new data, leading to poor real-world performance.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. These metrics are particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.\n",

        "3. **AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)**: This metric measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (0,0) to (1,1). It provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. This metric is also robust against imbalanced classes.\n",

        "* The function must be holomorphic (complex analytic) on the upper half-plane.\n",
        "* The function must be invariant under the action of the modular group SL(2,Z).\n",

        "The modularity condition is also interesting from a mathematical perspective. It is a difficult condition to satisfy, and there are only a finite number of modular forms of a given weight and level. This makes modular forms a rich and well-studied class of functions.\n",

        "Here is a more detailed explanation of the modularity condition:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Holomorphic on the upper half-plane:** This means that the function must be smooth and have no singularities in the upper half-plane, which is the set of complex numbers z such that Im(z) > 0.\n",
        "* **Invariant under the action of SL(2,Z):** This means that the function must be the same under the action of any element of the modular group SL(2,Z). The modular group is the group of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1.\n",
        "* **Fourier series expansion with only non-negative powers of q:** This means that the function can be written as a Fourier series with only non-negative powers of q, where q is a complex number such that |q| < 1.\n",

If we tried to implement this gate with a transversal gate, it would either flip all of the qubits in the register, or it would not flip any of them. This would not be a very useful gate!\n",

There are other choices where it is not the Clifford gates that can be implemented transversally. In that sense, there's nothing particularly special about Clifford.\n",

Either the C-NOT or the T will be the dominant contributer to the fault-tolerant threshold. Simplifying these implementations, or reducing the number of applications of these gates, potentially has a huge impact on how efficiently your quantum computer runs.

        "\n",
        "A mixed state and a product state are two different types of quantum states that arise in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, each with its own distinct properties and interpretations.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mixed State**: A mixed state describes a statistical mixture of different quantum states, each with a certain probability. Mathematically, a mixed state is represented by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian operator with trace 1. If a system is in a mixed state, it means we have some classical uncertainty about which specific quantum state it's in. For example, a system might be in state |0⟩ with probability 1/2 and in state |1⟩ with probability 1/2. This would correspond to the mixed state represented by the density matrix ρ = 1/2|0⟩⟨0| + 1/2|1⟩⟨1|.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Product State**: A product state refers to a state of a composite system that can be written as the tensor product of states of its subsystems. For example, if you have a two-qubit system and the first qubit is in state |0⟩ and the second qubit is in state |1⟩, the overall state of the system is the product state |0⟩⊗|1⟩, often written as |01⟩. A product state implies that there are no correlations between the subsystems, i.e., the subsystems are not entangled. If a state of a composite system cannot be written as a tensor product of states of its subsystems, it's called an entangled state.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, in summary, the difference lies in what each state represents: a mixed state represents classical uncertainty about which pure state a system is in, while a product state represents a separable (i.e., non-entangled) state of a composite system. Notably, these are not mutually exclusive: you can have a mixed state of product states, for example."

        "3. **Time Evolution**: Time evolution in quantum computing typically refers to how a quantum state changes over time according to the Schrödinger equation. It is often used to simulate physical systems in quantum simulations.\n",

        "4. **Phase Estimation**: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing which estimates the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. It's a key component in many quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and quantum simulation algorithms.\n",

Instead of using the time evolution operator (a more traditional approach to quantum simulations), this is advocating the use of block encoding and qubitization. These methods can provide a more resource-efficient approach for certain types of quantum computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, \"using filtering of the zero eigenvalue rather than phase estimation\" suggests a preferential way of isolating the states you're interested in. While phase estimation is a powerful tool, it can be resource-intensive. Filtering the zero eigenvalue might be a more efficient approach in certain contexts, particularly when zero eigenvalues represent \"unwanted\" states that might complicate or slow the computation."

The currently known examples are all contrived, and all rely on cryptographic methods to make learning hard for a classical learner. However, the broadly shared intuition is that learning separations should in particular be most apparent when the learning task involves data from genuinely quantum sources, which are very different from cryptographic problems. In this talk I will discuss this apparent discrepancy and present a series of new results showing various types of advatnages that can be obtained. In particular, we show how many complex physical systems have associated learning problems which exhibit exponential separations, subject to plausible assumptions in complexity theory, giving a confirmation of the intuition."

A major challenge in QNN development is a concentration of measure phenomenon known as a barren plateau that leads to exponentially small gradients for a range of QNNs models. In this work, we examine the assumptions that give rise to barren plateaus and show that an unbounded loss function can circumvent the existing no-go results. We propose a training algorithm that minimizes the maximal Renyi divergence of order two and present techniques for gradient computation. We compute the closed form of the gradients for Unitary QNNs and Quantum Boltzmann Machines and provide sufficient conditions for the absence of barren plateaus in these models. We demonstrate our approach in two use cases: thermal state learning and Hamiltonian learning. In our numerical experiments, we observed rapid convergence of our training loss function and frequently archived a 99% average fidelity in fewer than 100 epochs.\n"

        "Shadow tomography, also known as X-ray phase-contrast imaging or phase tomography, is a technique used to create detailed three-dimensional images of an object's internal structure. It is primarily employed in the field of medical imaging but also finds applications in materials science and other areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional X-ray imaging relies on the attenuation of X-rays as they pass through different tissues or materials, resulting in a two-dimensional projection image that shows variations in X-ray absorption. However, some tissues or materials have similar absorption properties, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on their attenuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography overcomes this limitation by exploiting the phase shift of X-rays as they pass through an object. When X-rays encounter a boundary between two materials with different refractive indices, they undergo a phase shift. This phase shift contains valuable information about the object's internal structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform shadow tomography, a coherent X-ray source, such as a synchrotron or an X-ray tube, is used. The X-rays pass through the object and are collected by a detector placed behind it. The collected X-rays contain both intensity and phase information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to shadow tomography lies in extracting the phase information from the intensity measurements. This is typically achieved by using specialized techniques such as interferometry or grating-based methods. These methods create interference patterns that encode the phase information, which can then be computationally reconstructed into a three-dimensional image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting shadow tomography image provides not only information about the X-ray absorption but also about the object's refractive index distribution and other structural features. This enables visualization of fine details, such as boundaries between tissues or subtle density variations, which may not be easily distinguishable in traditional X-ray images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance our understanding of complex biological and materials systems. However, it currently requires advanced X-ray sources and specialized techniques, limiting its widespread availability in clinical settings. Nevertheless, ongoing research and technological advancements aim to make shadow tomography more accessible and applicable in various fields."

In the simplest case, for a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix that is positive semi-definite and has trace 1. The generalization to multiple qubits is a matrix that is 2^n x 2^n (where n is the number of qubits), but with the same properties.\n",

        "Der Shor-Algorithmus lässt sich am besten für die Primfaktorzerlegung erklären. Damit Quantencomputer diese Aufgabe meistern können, muss man das Problem allerdings etwas umformulieren. Denn der Quantenalgorithmus stützt sich auf eine Anleitung zum Faktorisieren von Zahlen, die aus den 1970er Jahren stammt. Damals fand man heraus, dass nur vier Schritte nötig sind, um die Primfaktoren p und q einer Zahl N = p·q zu berechnen.\n",

        "[Hidden Subgroup Problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem) (HSP) generalizes many problems on which quantum computers offer a potential exponential speed-up over classical computers and derives its significance from two important and related questions. First, the study of the problem sheds some light on what it is that quantum computers are really good at. Second, the ability to solve HSP for non-Abelian groups in polynomial time would enable us to extend the set of problems on which quantum computers offer substantial performance advantage. In this introductory talk, I will recap essential concepts from group theory before defining the Hidden Subgroup Problem and describing the quantum algorithm that solves it quickly. I will end by showing how to express a number of well-known problems, such as Simon's problem, discrete logarithm and graph isomorphism, as instances of HSP.\n"

        "\n",
        "One of the key aspects that makes the HSP challenging is that the function only provides partial information about the subgroup. The function maps elements of the group to a set of values, but it does not directly reveal the subgroup itself. Instead, the function is designed in such a way that it distinguishes elements of different cosets of the hidden subgroup while keeping elements within the same coset indistinguishable. This limited information makes it difficult to directly extract the subgroup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge is that the HSP encompasses a wide range of group structures. While some specific cases of the problem have been efficiently solved using quantum algorithms, finding a general solution that works for arbitrary groups remains an open question. The difficulty varies depending on the properties and structure of the group involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the HSP is of particular interest in the field of quantum computing because it has the potential to break certain cryptographic protocols. Efficiently solving the HSP for specific groups could lead to the development of quantum algorithms that can break widely used encryption schemes based on problems like factoring large numbers or solving the Discrete Logarithm Problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite efforts to develop quantum algorithms for the HSP, no general solution has been found yet. The challenge lies in understanding the underlying mathematical structures, devising efficient algorithms, and leveraging the power of quantum computation to solve the problem in a scalable and practical manner."

Under some circumstances, when quantum effects are small, these expectation values follow trajectories similar to classical mechanics.\n",

The theorem states that the distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system. That is, the total phase space volume is conserved.\n",

        "\"There are (at least) two possible ways to formulate precisely (i.e. mathematically) elementary\n",
        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

Spin resonance spectroscopy is an important technique in fields as diverse as materials science, physics, chemistry and biology. In this study we demonstrate a device capable of beating the spin detection sensitivity of conventional spectrometers by many orders of magnitude. The performance matches previous demonstrations using superconducting quantum technologies, but importantly integrates the core components into a single device and works at higher magnetic fields and temperatures, which is critical for the practical use of this technology.

        "**How does quantum error correction work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for protecting quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Here's a high-level summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoding**: The first step in quantum error correction is to encode the quantum information. Rather than storing a quantum bit of information (a \"qubit\") in a single physical qubit, we store it in multiple physical qubits. This is done in such a way that, even if some of the physical qubits are corrupted by noise, the original quantum information can still be recovered. This encoding is done using a quantum error-correcting code. There are many different types of quantum error-correcting codes, each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syndrome measurement**: Once the quantum information has been encoded, the next step is to periodically check for errors. This is done by performing a syndrome measurement, which is a special kind of quantum measurement that can detect whether an error has occurred, and if so, what kind of error it was. Importantly, this measurement does not disturb the encoded quantum information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error correction**: If the syndrome measurement indicates that an error has occurred, the next step is to perform an error correction. This involves applying a series of quantum gates to the physical qubits to correct the error, based on the result of the syndrome measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Because quantum systems are always subject to noise, this process of syndrome measurement and error correction needs to be repeated periodically to keep the errors in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's worth noting that the whole process of quantum error correction requires a significant overhead in terms of additional physical qubits and quantum operations. This is a major challenge in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's also worth noting that, although quantum error correction can protect against many types of errors, it cannot protect against all possible errors. In particular, **it's assumed that the errors are relatively rare and do not all occur at once, and that they are independent and identically distributed across the physical qubits**. **If these assumptions are violated, then quantum error correction may not be able to correct the errors**. This is another major challenge in the field of quantum error correction."

        "In quantum computing, Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system. Symmetry is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it refers to the idea that a physical system will remain unchanged under certain transformations. For example, the symmetry of a quantum system may be described by a group of rotations, translations, or reflections. Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system because they have the useful property of being commutative, meaning that the order in which the transformations are applied does not affect the outcome. This property makes it possible to use Abelian groups to describe the symmetries of a quantum system in a way that is mathematically tractable and easy to work with."

        " I am also frustrated by us and the media representing these anyon simulations as a \"step towards fault-tolerance\". Certainly topological codes are inspired by the physics of anyons and there are direct analogies between how those codes work and are realized and these simulations. I also have no doubt that certain aspects of these simulations have some degree of error robustness. But my understanding is that once you get serious about turning such simulations into a form of fault-tolerance appropriate for our devices and then try to optimize its realization you end up with the surface code. So while thinking about the physics of error-correction from this perspective might be useful and there are myriad mathematical similarities between what is going on in these simulations and topological codes, I think it is misleading/wrong to claim that performing these simulations is taking us any closer to fault-tolerance (whether the surface code or a different form of it). People keep telling me that I am misunderstanding this (and maybe I am!) but I have not been convinced of that yet.\n",

        "my objection, which might be different from Cody's, is that the title of this blog post suggests that this experiment is getting us closer to realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In particular, when we say it is a step closer to improved quantum computers, it makes it sound like this approach is somehow a step on our roadmap for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers, or that it is going to make our ultimate goal easier or something like that. That is reading between the lines a little bit, but it is how it sounds to me. Is that actually true? Or is this in the category of \"nice demonstration, but not something we're going to follow up on, and thus not a step towards us improving quantum computers other than in the very broad sense that it helps test hardware capabilities like most physics team experiments do\"? My understanding is that nothing about this experiment is likely to change anything about how we are planning to realize fault-tolerance. Maybe that is incorrect, or it is correct and I am just reading too much into the implications of statements like the title. It would be nice to understand this better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main sense in which the non-abelian anyons are useful for fault tolerance is that they are isomorphic to twists in the surface code, and you can use twists to store logical qubits. But we already knew about twists independent of this work e.g. from https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04673 so I don't know what it adds on the fault tolerance side.\n",
        "\n",
        "I did give a presentation to the authors of our abelian paper on how to do it fault tolerantly (they were technically \"using\" a surface code, but they were preparing it entirely unitarily which is not fault tolerant; you have to use measurements for everything). They weren't so interested I think, because the measurement version is harder and maybe also because they didn't consider it \"really doing it\" in the same way. I actually did run some quick shots of my versions of the circuits on the device back when pink was in M2 shape, and it worked, in that I got non-zero signal (the error rate was close to max but not max). I wasn't doing adept or etc or etc; if an experimentalist did it it would have been better. Also I now have much better versions of the circuit, which are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07395 .\n",
        "\n",
        "My point was that if you interpret TQC as broadly (\"you have things that act like anyons\") then this is demonstrating something interesting (multiparticle entangled EC state, FT gates on that state).  But I also agree with Ryan in that I think the blog post does not convey this well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fair enough, I'm just trying to put forth a perspective on why it is fine to say this is an interesting experiment in topological quantum computation.

In fact, with collaborators we have proven that the color code is equivalent to a surface code (paper) up to a geometrically local unitary (one which only makes nearby qubits interact). One can think by analogy of the surface code* as a napkin with two rough and two smooth sides and the color code as folding this napkin along its diagonal. Because in the folded napkin, there are new things that are now close, it is possible to do more logical gates \"transversally\". This is good because it keeps errors from propagating and is relatively easy. However, the color code needs more qubits to interact in each stabilizer so ends up leading to a lower noise threshold. So one can say that although very similar, each code has its advantages and disadvantages.\n",

However, the underlying geometry in which the qubits are laid out in the Blatt setup is a linear chain of ions, so I would say that this is not the natural setting to extend to larger and larger system sizes.\n",

While in principle, their architecture should allow them to go full fledge 2D, for now, they are having the classical logic come in from the sides, which is something that needs to change.\n",
