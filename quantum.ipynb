Mathematically, a mixed state is represented by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian operator with trace 1. If a system is in a mixed state, it means we have some classical uncertainty about which specific quantum state it's in. For example, a system might be in state |0⟩ with probability 1/2 and in state |1⟩ with probability 1/2. This would correspond to the mixed state represented by the density matrix ρ = 1/2|0⟩⟨0| + 1/2|1⟩⟨1|.\n",

For example, if you have a two-qubit system and the first qubit is in state |0⟩ and the second qubit is in state |1⟩, the overall state of the system is the product state |0⟩⊗|1⟩, often written as |01⟩. A product state implies that there are no correlations between the subsystems, i.e., the subsystems are not entangled. If a state of a composite system cannot be written as a tensor product of states of its subsystems, it's called an entangled state.\n",

In quantum mechanics, we often want to find eigenstates of operators because these correspond to \"observable\" states of the system with definite values of the associated physical quantity. For the momentum operator, the eigenstates are plane waves, which are not square-integrable and hence do not belong to the Hilbert space.\n",

        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

Named after Paul Ehrenfest, who proved it in 1927, it demonstrates how the expectation values (average values) of quantum observables (like position and momentum) evolve with time. Under some circumstances, when quantum effects are small, these expectation values follow trajectories similar to classical mechanics.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Liouville's Theorem**: In classical statistical mechanics, Liouville's theorem describes the time evolution of phase space distribution function (a function that gives the probability of the system to be in a certain state with given position and momentum) in a Hamiltonian system (a system governed by Hamilton's equations). The theorem states that the distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system. That is, the total phase space volume is conserved.\n",

        "Um einen quantenmechanischen Zustand eindeutig zu charakterisieren, sind oft mehrere Observablen notwendig. Beispielsweise ist es beim Wasserstoffatom nicht ausreichend, nur die Energie anzugeben (mittels der Hauptquantenzahl n), sondern es sind zwei weitere Observablen notwendig: der Betrag des Drehimpulses (Quantenzahl l) und die z-Komponente des Drehimpuls (Quantenzahl m). Diese drei Größen bilden dann einen vollständigen Satz kommutierender Observablen.\n",
        "Eine Menge von Observablen A, B, C,... bildet einen v.S.k.O., wenn eine orthonormale Basis des Zustandsraums aus gemeinsamen Eigenvektoren der Observablen existiert, und diese Basis (bis auf einen Phasenfaktor) eindeutig ist.\n",
