        "An **entangled NOON state** is a quantum superposition involving \\( N \\) photons that are all in one of two possible modes or paths. The name \"NOON\" comes from the specific form of this state, which can be mathematically expressed as:\n",

        "- The modes \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can refer to different paths in an interferometer, different spatial locations, or other quantum degrees of freedom.\n",

        "**Future Quantum Sensors in Astronomy**\n",

        "Implementing entangled NOON states in astronomical observations could revolutionize the field by:\n",

        "- **Enhancing Resolution**: Observing fine details of distant celestial objects that are currently unresolvable.\n",
        "- **Improving Sensitivity**: Detecting weaker signals that might be lost in classical measurements.\n",
        "- **Reducing Telescope Size**: Achieving higher resolution without necessarily increasing the physical size of telescopes.\n",

        "Practical realization involves challenges like generating high-quality NOON states for large \\( N \\), dealing with photon losses, and maintaining coherence over astronomical distances. Ongoing research in quantum optics and technology development aims to overcome these hurdles, potentially enabling the use of NOON states in future quantum-enhanced astronomical instruments."
